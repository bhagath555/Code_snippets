0gb1HsAjRk-2utqEACKFWQ	"Laundrie Spotted in Montana a Day Before Petito's Disappearance, Witness Claims

West Yellowstone, MT - A Montana bartender has come forward claiming to have seen Brian Laundrie, the sole suspect in the disappearance and death of his fiancée Gabby Petito, in a local bar on Aug. 26, the day before Petito was last seen alive.

Hunter Mannies, a former deputy, told The New York Post that he and a friend encountered Laundrie at Bullwinkle's Saloon in West Yellowstone, Montana. Mannies described Laundrie as appearing ""mad at the world"" and sitting alone at the bar.

""He had that look in his eyes like he was angry at the world,"" Mannies said. ""He was glaring at people.""

According to Mannies, Laundrie engaged in a conversation with him and his friend that included topics such as hunting, guns, and politics. During the conversation, Laundrie allegedly insulted Southerners and Republicans.

""He was just rambling on about how much he hated Southerners and Republicans,"" Mannies said. ""It was really bizarre.""

Mannies said Laundrie identified himself by name during the conversation.

""He looked me in the eye and said, 'My name is Brian Laundrie,'"" Mannies said. ""I remember it clearly.""

Mannies and his friend exchanged a look, noting that Laundrie's behavior was odd and gave them a ""weird vibe.""

""Something about him just didn't feel right,"" Mannies said. ""He was overly invested in our conversation, like he was trying to prove something.""

After Petito's disappearance was reported in the news, Mannies' friend recognized Laundrie from the bar and alerted Mannies. Upon viewing body camera footage of Laundrie and Petito, Mannies confirmed that the man he had seen at the bar was Laundrie.

""I'm 100% sure it was him,"" Mannies said. ""There's no doubt in my mind.""

Mannies reported his sighting to the FBI and spoke with them for about 45 minutes. He provided a sworn statement and gave them his contact information.

""I know what I saw,"" Mannies said. ""I'm not making this up.""

Gabby Petito's remains were discovered in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest on Sept. 19. Her death was ruled a homicide. Laundrie, who had returned to his parents' home in Florida without Petito on Sept. 1, vanished a few days later. He is now the subject of a nationwide manhunt.

The Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump will start the week of Feb. 8.

The article begins with a brief headline: ""Ladies and gentlemen, today marks the start of the impeachment trial against Donald Trump.""

A short paragraph begins:

""Senators on Monday, February 8th, formally begin the trial proceedings in the Senate on Monday, Feb. 8th."" This is an important milestone for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as the President of the United States faces the challenge of seeking to remove him from office in the wake of the election results. McConnell has been publicly criticizing Trump's decision to fire James Comey, and has been calling for a second trial to pave the way for the President's impeachment.

The article then goes on to highlight the importance of due process and fairness. McConnell stated that the trial should take place on Monday, which is a day before the trial begins, as it will demonstrate that the President's actions have been lawful and fair.

The article also covers the possibility that the Senate will consider impeaching Trump during his own time as President. McConnell has said that the impeachment trial could prove difficult, and that he will not seek to undo any of Trump's actions. Additionally, McConnell has emphasized that the President must make amends for any possible legal issues, including whether he acted illegally.

The article continues:

""The Attorney General's Office is currently investigating possible obstruction of justice and misconduct in the Trump Administration. There is no indication that they are considering any new charges against Attorney General Jeff Sessions.""

A headline reads: ""The Senate's Approval of the Importance of Due Process and Fairness in the U.S.""

2KGMCgZaS6quDwafurHo2A	"Miami Nurse Arrested for Threatening to Kill Vice President Kamala Harris: Reports

MIAMI, Fla. – Niviane Petit Phelps, a nurse at Jackson Memorial Hospital, was arrested on Thursday for allegedly threatening to kill U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, according to multiple reports.

Phelps, 47, reportedly recorded and sent five 30-second videos and two photographs to her imprisoned husband using JPay, a communication app for those incarcerated. In the videos, she expressed her hatred for President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris, making direct threats against Harris, including a promise of violence and death.

The Miami Herald reported that Phelps was seen at a shooting range in photographs dated Feb. 20, 2021, and she applied for a concealed weapons permit two days later. It is unclear if she has been issued the permit.

Phelps' mother appealed to the president and vice president for forgiveness in a letter, suggesting her daughter did not mean the threats. ""I am begging your mercy for my daughter,"" she wrote. ""She has been going through a difficult time since the passing of my husband, her father, last year in March.""

Jackson Health System has suspended Phelps without pay and is processing her employment termination. In a statement to Local 10 News, the hospital said, ""Jackson takes all threats of violence seriously and has zero tolerance for such behavior.""

Phelps told investigators she was angry about Kamala Harris becoming vice president but is ""over it now,"" according to the Miami Herald. However, threatening government officials of the United States is a felony offense, potentially leading to up to five years in federal prison.

The Secret Service is investigating the case, and Phelps was taken into federal custody on Thursday. She is being held without bond at the Federal Detention Center in Miami.

This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Phelps' arrest comes as tensions remain high in the country following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, which left five people dead and over 140 officers injured. Threats against government officials have increased in the aftermath of the riots, leading to increased security measures and investigations.

According to the U.S. Capitol Police, there have been over 10,000 threats against members of Congress since the riots. The FBI has also reported a significant increase in threats against government officials and institutions.

The arrest of Phelps serves as a reminder of the seriousness of such threats and the importance of maintaining the safety"

At least 31 law-enforcement officers are suspected of playing a role in the Capitol riot, per the Associated Press.

Several off-duty cops have been found to be involved in the attack on the US government.

Police departments are under pressure to filter out recruits who belong to white-nationalist groups.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

At least 31 police officers in law-enforcement agencies across the US are under investigation over their suspected role in the January 6 Capitol riot, reported the Associated Press.

In the wake of the riot, it emerged that several off-duty police officers and members of the US military had been involved in the pro-Trump protest that spiralled into attack on the US government.

Investigators are seeking to establish whether officers only attended the rally where Trump spoke, or whether they were involved in the subsequent violence at the Capitol.

A Capitol Police officer and Trump supporter were killed in the unrest, and three more people died in medical emergencies.

According to the AP, officers from Los Angeles, a small community in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma are among those under investigation.

On Friday, the Seattle police said that two officers had been placed on leave while their involvement in the riot is investigated.

Two Virginia police officers who posted a selfie inside the Capitol during the attack were also arrested and charged earlier this month.

Officers Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson of Virginia were arrested after posting this selfie. US Attorney's Office, District of Columbia

The FBI has launched a wide-ranging investigation to identify and arrest those involved in the riot.

The Capitol riot has also raised questions about the infiltration of police forces by white-nationalist and far-right groups.

Members of extremist movements were among the rioters on January 6, with protesters carrying flags or wearing insignia of far-right groups.

Experts have warned that far-right infiltration of US police is a problem that has long been ignored, and that measures need to be introduced to screen potential police recruits for affiliation with white nationalist groups."

After a harrowing car crash in February, golf legend Tiger Woods is reportedly in good spirits but has yet to swing a club. A source close to Woods revealed that he has not visited his South Florida restaurant, The Woods Jupiter, since before the accident.

Woods' fellow golfer, Rickie Fowler, provided an update on his rehab process, describing it as ""a long road ahead."" Fowler noted that Woods is ""working hard"" and ""staying positive.""

On February 23, Woods was involved in a single-vehicle rollover crash in Southern California. He sustained significant orthopedic injuries, including ""comminuted open fractures"" to his lower right extremity.

Dr. Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where Woods was treated, said the golfer underwent surgery to stabilize his injuries. Mahajan described the injuries as ""very serious"" and said Woods had ""a long way to go"" in his recovery.

According to documents released by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Woods had no recollection of driving or how the accident occurred. Sheriff Alex Villanueva stated that speed was the primary cause of the crash, with no signs of impairment found.

4gD_AhURS8uHzQRvrLr6vw	"Four Former Minneapolis Police Officers Indicted on Federal Civil Rights Charges for Death of George Floyd; Derek Chauvin Also Charged in Separate Indictment for Violating Civil Rights of a Juvenile

WASHINGTON — A federal grand jury in Minneapolis, Minnesota, returned two indictments that were unsealed today. The first indictment charges former Minneapolis Police Department officers Derek Chauvin, 45; Tou Thao, 35; J. Alexander Kueng, 27; and Thomas Lane, 38, with federal civil rights crimes for their roles in the death of George Perry Floyd Jr.

The three-count indictment alleges that all four defendants, while acting under color of law, willfully deprived Mr. Floyd of his constitutional rights, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 242. Specifically, Count One of the indictment alleges that on May 25, 2020, Chauvin held his left knee across Mr. Floyd's neck, and his right knee on Floyd's back and arm, as George Floyd lay on the ground, handcuffed and unresisting, and kept his knees on Mr. Floyd's neck and body even after Mr. Floyd became unresponsive. The indictment alleges that Chauvin's actions violated Mr. Floyd's constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer and resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of, Mr. Floyd.

Count Two of the indictment charges that Thao and Kueng willfully failed to intervene to stop Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, resulting in bodily injury to, and the death of, Mr. Floyd. Finally, Count Three of the indictment alleges that all four defendants saw Mr. Floyd lying on the ground in clear need of medical care and willfully failed to aid him. The indictment alleges that by doing so, all four defendants willfully deprived Mr. Floyd of his constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, which includes an arrestee's right to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The indictment alleges that this offense resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of, Mr. Floyd.

A separate, two-count indictment also charges Chauvin with willfully depriving a Minneapolis resident who was then fourteen-years-old of the constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 242. Count One of this indictment alleges that on Sept. 4, 2017, Chauvin, without legal justification, held the teenager by the throat and struck the teenager multiple times in the head with a flashlight. The indictment alleges that this offense included the use of a dangerous weapon—a flashlight—and resulted"
50wbJSGTQ3qcUmWAsjRffw	"North Korea Flexes Military Muscle in Parade, Vows to Strengthen Nuclear Arsenal

In a show of force just days before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, North Korea staged a military parade in Pyongyang to celebrate the first congress of the ruling Workers' Party in nearly five years. The parade featured what North Korea claims are ""the world's most powerful"" weapons, including a submarine-launched ballistic missile, and was attended by leader Kim Jong Un, who did not make a speech.

Defense Minister Kim Jong Gwan stated during the parade that North Korea would preemptively use power to smash hostile forces threatening the state's security. Thousands of troops participating in the parade did not wear masks, aligning with North Korea's claim of being COVID-19 free.

During the eight-day congress, Kim Jong Un called the U.S. Pyongyang's ""foremost principal enemy"" and pledged to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. Kim suggested maintaining a strong defense does not preclude diplomacy and hinted at continued talks if the U.S. withdraws its hostile policy. Kim Jong Un was elected general secretary of the ruling party, a significant leadership position formerly held by his late father.

North Korea faces economic challenges, including a significant drop in trade with China due to strict COVID-19 measures and natural disasters affecting agriculture. Despite these challenges, Kim Jong Un has vowed to continue developing the country's nuclear program.

""We will continue to strengthen our nuclear arsenal and preemptively use power to smash hostile forces threatening our state's security,"" Kim Jong Gwan said during the parade. ""We will not be swayed by the incoming U.S. administration's hostile policy towards us.""

Kim Jong Un was elected as the general secretary of the Workers' Party, a position he has held since the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. The election was seen as a symbol of Kim's consolidation of power and a sign that he will continue his family's legacy as the leader of North Korea.

""We will continue to maintain a strong defense and strengthen our nuclear arsenal, but we are also open to diplomacy and talks with the U.S. if they are willing to withdraw their hostile policy towards us,"" Kim Jong Un said in a statement released after the parade. ""We will not be bullied or intimidated by the U.S. or any other country, and we will continue to protect our sovereignty and security at all costs.""

The parade and congress come at a time of heightened tensions between North Korea and the U.S., with both countries engaging in a series of military exercises and rhetorical exchanges in recent months. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on North Korea in an effort to pressure the country to give up its nuclear weapons program, while North Korea has accused the U.S. of plotting to overthrow its government.

""The U.S. is our foremost principal enemy, and we will not hesitate to use force to defend ourselves against their aggression,"" Kim Jong Gwan said during the parade. ""We will continue to develop our nuclear arsenal and maintain a strong"

The Washington, D.C., area began the cleanup process on Thursday after being hit hard by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, which brought tornadoes and heavy rain, causing significant damage and hindering the morning commute in several locations.

High water and fallen trees caused major disruptions in Prince George's County and Montgomery County, making for a challenging morning commute for residents. The National Weather Service reported tornadoes in Anne Arundel County and Edgewater, Maryland.

In Edgewater, Maryland, a tornado left a trail of destruction, including tossing a pickup truck, downing trees, and power lines. Rick Casciato, a resident, described the scene as ""terrifying."" (Quote: ""It was terrifying. I've never seen anything like this before. The trees were uprooted, power lines were down, and debris was everywhere."")

Amtrak canceled all service between Washington and Boston due to the aftermath of the storm, leaving thousands of travelers stranded.

Frederick County Public Schools were closed Thursday following the severe weather, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning in Frederick County, Maryland, with the Monocacy River rising significantly above flood stage.

The National Weather Service plans to investigate two reported tornadoes in Maryland, one in Anne Arundel County and the other in Edgewater.

The tornado in Anne Arundel County caused extensive damage, including downing electrical wires and damaging homes. South River High School's football stadium was also affected by the storm.

Anne Arundel Police expressed their gratitude to first responders from neighboring areas for their assistance in the aftermath of the storm. (Quote: ""We are grateful for the outpouring of support from our neighboring jurisdictions. Their help has been invaluable as we work to assess the damage and ensure the safety of our residents."")

The tornado in Anne Arundel County was one of several that touched down in the region, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. The storm brought heavy rain and strong winds, causing power outages and flooding in various areas.

6CaG0R-zTRqDaRYsDvzTyQ	"A bank accidentally deposited $50 billion into a Louisiana family's account

CNN — For four days, Darren James and his family were multibillionaires.

The real estate agent from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and his wife were doing a routine check on their finances last Saturday when they noticed $50 billion had been mistakenly deposited into their Chase Bank account.

""That's not like a one zero error or a two zero error, that's somebody that fell asleep on the keyboard error,"" James joked. ""I was excited for sure. Really surprised how it got there and wondered if I had a rich uncle that gave it to me.""

But to his disappointment, it wasn't an inheritance – just an incredibly unusual error.

Chase Bank restored the family's account to its correct balance on Tuesday, James said.

""We're still trying to figure out what happened, why it happened, how it happened, but we know we aren't the only ones this happened to,"" he told CNN. ""The concern is whether my account was compromised, and the bank hasn't even called me. We haven't heard anything from anyone.""

Chase Bank acknowledged the mistake to CNN, but gave a different timeline for when it was fixed.

""We had a technical glitch a couple weeks ago impacting a limited number of accounts. The issue was resolved one day later and all accounts are showing accurate balances,"" Chase Bank spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus told CNN.

People who spend money mistakenly deposited into their bank accounts can be made to return the funds, pay fees and even be charged with crimes. In 2019, a Pennsylvania couple faced felony theft charges after their bank accidentally deposited $120,000 into their account, and the couple spent most of it instead of contacting the bank, police said.

But James said he never considered spending any of the money.

""My moral compass only goes one way and that's the correct way,"" he said. ""There's a big difference between morality and legality. Honesty and good moral character immediately kicked in, we can't do anything with the money. I didn't earn it, it's not ours to spend.""

Still, he quipped: ""Unless it was a rich uncle or one of those emails I probably responded to from a Saudi Arabian prince who promised to give me $50 billion, that's a different story.""

James said if the family was able to keep the money, they would have tried to ""bless"" others in need."

In a surprising turn of events, lawyers for the three police officers charged in the death of George Floyd have requested that their trial be closed to live broadcast, citing concerns about witness reluctance due to the extensive media coverage of Derek Chauvin's trial. Thomas Lane, J. Kueng, and Tou Thao's lawyers, Earl Gray, Tom Plunkett, and Robert Paule, respectively, argued that the widespread coverage of Chauvin's trial has compromised their clients' right to a fair trial.

""The extensive media coverage of Derek Chauvin's trial has created a hostile environment for our clients' witnesses,"" Gray said in court. ""Many of them have expressed reluctance to testify in a trial that will be broadcast live, and we fear that their safety and privacy will be compromised if the trial is televised.""

Plunkett echoed Gray's concerns, stating that the publicity surrounding Chauvin's trial has made it difficult to find impartial jurors. ""The constant media attention has created a bias against our clients, and we fear that a live broadcast of their trial will only exacerbate this problem,"" he said.

Paule added that the livestreaming of Chauvin's trial has set a dangerous precedent, arguing that it has compromised the integrity of the justice system. ""By broadcasting Derek Chauvin's trial, the court has created a situation where the public is more interested in sensationalism than in ensuring a fair trial,"" he said. ""We cannot allow this to happen to our clients.""

However, prosecutors argue that the livestreaming of the trial would actually benefit the public by providing greater transparency and accountability in the justice system. ""The public has a right to know what happens in a trial of this magnitude,"" said Assistant Hennepin County Attorney, Sarah Sjoblom. ""By broadcasting the trial, we can ensure that the public is informed and engaged in the justice process.""

Lawyers for news outlets, including The Associated Press, have also argued against the ban, emphasizing the public's right to monitor the trial. ""The public has a right to know what happens in a trial of this magnitude,"" said AP lawyer, Tom Gitaa. ""By broadcasting the trial, we can ensure that the public is informed and engaged in the justice process.""

Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over Chauvin's televised trial, will now decide on the livestreaming request. Cahill has not yet indicated when he will make a decision, but the outcome of the livestreaming request and other motions related to evidence requests and witness coercion allegations are likely to have a significant impact on the trial.

Vice President Kamala Harris rejected the idea that Democratic Senator Joe Manchin had betrayed the White House when he said that he would not support President Biden's $1.75 trillion social spending plan, dealing a potentially fatal blow to the bill.

""I think the stakes are too high for this to be in any way about any specific individual,"" Harris said Monday in an interview with Margaret Brennan, chief foreign affairs correspondent for CBS News and moderator of ""Face the Nation.""

""I don't have any personal feelings about this. This is about – let's get the job done. Let's get it done."" Brennan noted that one of the key provisions in the bill, the year-long extension of the Child Tax Credit has already expired. Harris insisted, ""We have to extend it,"" but on the question of how to do that without Manchin's support, the vice president said, ""You don't give up. That's how we do it. We don't give up. That's how.""

Vice President Kamala Harris interviewed by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Dec. 12, 2021. CBS News

Manchin backed out of negotiations with the White House on Sunday, citing inflation, the national debt and the COVID-19 pandemic.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that the West Virginia senator's remarks represented ""a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator's colleagues in the House and Senate.""

By Monday, Manchin was fuming. He told West Virginia's ""Talkline with Hoppy Kercheval"" that Democrats had erred in thinking they could pressure him into backing the social spending package and blamed White House staff for the collapse in negotiations, saying ""they put some things out that were absolutely inexcusable.""

""They figured, surely to God we can move one person, surely we can badger and beat one person up, surely we can get enough protesters to make that person uncomfortable enough they'll just say, 'OK, I'll vote for anything,' just quit,"" he said."

WILMINGTON, N.C. (WTVD) -- Slain Florida woman Gabby Petito once lived and worked in North Carolina.

Gabby Petito: Timeline of everything we know about her disappearance

Gabby Petito was traveling with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, in a cargo van the two had outfitted as a makeshift recreational vehicle for a months-long cross-country road trip when she mysteriously disappeared.

From September 2017 to January 2019, Petito was a hostess and kitchen aide at Smoke on the Water, a restaurant at Carolina Beach.

WWAY spoke with Petito's friends and co-workers in the Wilmington area. They all said how much Petito loved everyone and make everyone around her feel loved.

""Gabby was a bright soul, a bright light. She was always happy, always had a smile on her face trying to bring people up with her,"" Smoke on the Water General Manager Lara Witschen said. ""She was a good soul, a good spirit, and touched so many lives. That's what we want her to be remembered for.""

Gabby Petito case shines spotlight on missing people of color, including Jelani Day, Maya Millete

How the Gabby Petito case is igniting new interest in finding other missing persons.

The restaurant set up a table in Petito's memory. The restaurant also plans to plant a tree as a lasting memorial to Petito.

Petito was killed while on a cross country vacation with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie. Her body was found at a national park in Wyoming. The coroner confirmed Petito died by homicide but said her official cause of death would remain pending until the final autopsy results are available.

Laundrie is a person of interest in the case. He took off into hiding more than a week ago after returning to his parent's home in Florida.

Law enforcement said it received reports of a possible sighting of Laundrie in Florida on Monday or Tuesday night, but after an extensive search that lead turned up empty.

7kZAZ-n2Sku2upuAIvvPLw	"Nightmare on Snow Street: Neighborly Dispute Ends in Tragic Double Homicide

A peaceful winter morning in the quiet community of Plains Township, Pennsylvania, turned into a chilling nightmare when a snow shoveling dispute escalated into a deadly shooting, claiming the lives of James and Lisa Goy. The incident, captured on a neighbor's surveillance camera, has left the community reeling in shock and disbelief.

The victims, identified as 50-year-old James Goy and 48-year-old Lisa Goy, were engaged in the mundane task of shoveling snow from their driveway when the unthinkable occurred. According to authorities, a verbal altercation ensued with their neighbor, 47-year-old Jeffrey Spaide, over snow being shoveled onto his property.

As tensions mounted, the situation spiraled out of control. Spaide, who was armed with a handgun, opened fire on the Goys, striking them multiple times. Not content with the deadly barrage, Spaide retrieved an AR-style rifle and unleashed another volley of gunfire, ensuring their demise.

The chilling surveillance footage captures the horrifying sequence of events. The Goys can be heard hurling insults at Spaide before he retaliates with deadly force. The video also shows Spaide pacing back and forth in his yard before committing suicide as police officers arrived on the scene.

A motive for the heinous act remains shrouded in uncertainty. According to neighbors, there had been a prior altercation between the Goys and Spaide, but there were no official police records of previous incidents. Prosecutors have indicated that Spaide was seen pacing back and forth before taking his own life, suggesting a troubled mind and a growing sense of desperation.

Jeffrey Spaide, an engineer and US Navy veteran, is described in an online obituary as a ""loving son, brother, and uncle."" The obituary makes no mention of the tragic incident that took the lives of his neighbors and ended his own.

The Goys are remembered as loving parents to their 15-year-old autistic son. Their sudden and senseless deaths have left an unfillable void in his life and the community at large. The double homicide has shattered the once-tranquil neighborhood, leaving residents shaken and fearful.

Authorities have emphasized the importance of resolving conflicts peacefully and have urged community members to seek assistance if they find themselves embroiled in escalating disputes.

8DGTxVrjSKeWcqaI-QgUBQ	"Texas Utility Bills to Surge After Winter Storm's Power Grid Crisis

Feb 18 (Reuters) – Texas residents are bracing for higher utility bills following a winter storm that caused widespread power outages and sent wholesale electricity prices soaring.

About 2.7 million households in Texas were without power at the peak of the storm, as freezing temperatures overwhelmed the state's power grid. Wholesale power prices in Texas spiked more than 300-fold, reminiscent of California's energy crisis in 2000-2001.

State utilities are expected to increase bills to cover the cost of the price spikes and future grid updates.

""This is going to be a very expensive event for Texas ratepayers,"" said Tyson Slocum, director of the Energy Program at Public Citizen.

Texas operates an independent power grid, which is not connected to the national grid. This isolation led to price spikes in electricity during demand shortages.

""We have a very unique situation in Texas where we have our own grid,"" said Bill Magness, chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state's power grid. ""That means that when we have a shortage of supply, the prices can go very high.""

Concerns have been raised about potential market manipulation similar to the Enron scandal, though there is no evidence of this yet.

""We need to look very carefully at what happened during this event to make sure that there was no market manipulation,"" said Jay Apt, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center.

ERCOT's reserve margin, which is the amount of spare generating capacity available, has dwindled in recent years, putting pressure on generators during spikes in electricity demand.

""We need to review how extreme weather affects the reliability of our generators,"" said Magness. ""We may need to consider winterizing more of our equipment.""

Most consumers with fixed-rate plans will avoid the massive price spikes, but variable-rate customers could face hefty bills.

Griddy, a Houston-based power retailer, advised its customers to switch providers due to the soaring costs.

""We are deeply sorry for the financial hardship this has caused our customers,"" said Griddy in a statement.

The Texas Public Utility Commission has ordered an investigation into the power outages and price spikes.

""We are committed to getting to the bottom of what happened and taking action to prevent it from happening again,"" said PUC Chairman Peter Lake.

The storm has highlighted the need for reforms to the Texas power grid.

""We need to make sure that our grid is resilient to extreme weather events,"" said Slocum. ""We also need to make sure that the market is fair and competitive.""

8PuGOvCHTNmHjiQ8YFzgIg	"Kamala Harris' office doing clean-up after exchange with student on Israel

CNN — Vice President Kamala Harris's office is trying to contain the fallout from an exchange earlier this week between the vice president and a student who characterized Israel's actions toward Palestinians as ""an ethnic genocide and a displacement of people.""

While visiting a political science class at George Mason University on Tuesday to honor national voter registration day, Harris took questions from three students, including one who brought up the nation's funding of Israel in a lengthy question.

""You brought up how the power of the people and demonstrations and organizing is very valuable in America. I see that over the summer, there have been, like, protests and demonstrations and astronomical numbers done with Palestine, but then just a few days ago there were funds allocated to continue backing Israel, which hurts my heart because it's an ethnic genocide and a displacement of people – the same that happened in America and I'm sure you're aware of this,"" the student said in part of her question, saying that the funding occurs as Americans suffer at home.

""And I feel like there's a lack of listening, and I just feel like I need to bring that up because it affects my life and people I really care about's life ...,"" the student added.

Harris, whose husband – second gentleman Doug Emhoff – is Jewish, responded, ""I'm glad you did.""

""And again, this is about the fact that your voice, your perspective, your experience, your truth cannot be suppressed, and it must be heard. ... Our goal should be unity, but not uniformity,"" Harris said. ""And the point that you're making about policies that relates to Middle East policy, foreign policy. We still have healthy debates in our country, about what is the right path. And nobody's voice should be suppressed on that.""

The lack of push back from Harris to the student while taking questions during the visit has become the latest hiccup for her office that faced a turbulent summer, fueled in part by messaging mishaps. This latest communication mishap comes on a particularly fraught topic as progressives and other activists have been putting pressure on Democrats to take a more critical stance toward Israel, which has long enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington.

After that exchange, Harris' senior staff has been reaching out to the heads of several leading pro-Israel organizations, per a source familiar with Harris' office.

Her team began reaching out to the heads of several leading Jewish organizations after those leaders reached out to the White House to express their concerns, two people with direct knowledge of the conversations said. Harris' deputy national security adviser Phil Gordon and Herbie Ziskend, the vice president's deputy communications director, led the outreach, the sources said, making clear that Harris's silence did not equate agreement with the students' claims of ""ethnic genocide.""

""There's a recognition that the impression left by her failure to correct the student is problematic and does not reflect her commitment to a strong US-Israel relationship, nor that of the President and the"
9e8SiY-ATnmjZGLUGAuoMg	"Taliban Warns of 'Consequences' as Kabul Airport Chaos Escalates

Kabul, Afghanistan - The Taliban has issued a stern warning to the United States and its allies, declaring that there will be ""consequences"" if their troops remain in Afghanistan beyond the agreed-upon August 31 deadline for withdrawal. This warning comes amid escalating chaos and violence at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport, where a firefight involving US, German, and Afghan guards resulted in one dead and three wounded.

Despite the perilous situation, the US military reported its largest day of airlifts out of Afghanistan on Thursday, with over 10,400 people evacuated in a 24-hour period. This surge in evacuations is a testament to the urgency of the situation, as the Taliban's deadline looms large.

In a bid to facilitate the evacuation of Afghans who have worked closely with the European Union (EU), French special forces escorted about 260 individuals to the Kabul airport. This operation underscores the international community's commitment to protecting those who have risked their lives in support of democratic values.

Taliban Spokesman Warns Against Extending Deadline

Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen made it clear that any attempt to extend the August 31 deadline would be viewed as ""extending occupation,"" a statement that underscores the group's determination to assert its authority over Afghanistan. This stance further complicates the already challenging evacuation efforts, as the window of opportunity for foreign nationals and vulnerable Afghans to leave the country narrows.

Airport Access Issues Hamper Evacuation Efforts

The situation at Kabul airport has been further exacerbated by issues with airport access, with Taliban checkpoints and massive crowds hindering the smooth flow of evacuees. German foreign minister Heiko Maas described the airport situation as increasingly chaotic, emphasizing the need for urgent action to ensure the safety and security of those seeking to depart.

France Evacuates Afghans with EU Ties

France's envoy to Afghanistan, David Martinon, reported the successful evacuation of 260 Afghans who had worked with the EU. This operation was made possible through the assistance of French special forces and the US army, demonstrating the collaborative efforts of international partners in the face of adversity.

Taliban Confronts Armed Opposition

While the focus remains on the evacuation efforts in Kabul, the Taliban is also facing armed opposition in other parts of the country. In Baghlan province, clashes between the Taliban and local militias have been reported, while the group has surrounded Panjshir province, the last remaining province not under Taliban control.

US Enlists Commercial Airlines for Evacuation

In an effort to expedite the evacuation process, the US has enlisted the help of six commercial airlines to transport people after their evacuation from Afghanistan. This move is aimed at increasing the capacity for evacuations and ensuring that those who have fled the country can reach safety as swiftly as possible.

9QDl4VWpT_aU6eduVJobBA	"Social platforms flex their power, lock down Trump accounts

After years of treating President Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric with a light touch, Facebook and Instagram are silencing his social media accounts for the rest of his presidency. The move, which many called long overdue following Wednesday's deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, is also a reminder of the enormous power that social-media platforms can wield when they choose.

Facebook and Instagram said Thursday they will bar Trump from posting at least until the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.

A 12-hour lockdown of Trump's account ended Thursday and the president used his restored account to post a video in which he acknowledged for the first time that his presidency will end soon.

It remains unclear how the platforms will handle Trump once he leaves office and is no longer shielded from enforcement of most rules by his status as a world leader. And some critics saw the moves as cynical efforts by the companies to position themselves for a post-Trump future.

""They no longer have to fear Donald Trump,"" said Rashad Robinson of Color of Change, a group that has pushed tech companies to do more to rein in hate speech. He said Facebook's action was ""in the best interest of Facebook"" and a way to curry favor with the incoming Democratic president and Congress.

In announcing the unprecedented move, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing Trump to use the platform is too great following the president's incitement of a mob on Wednesday. Zuckerberg said Trump's account will be locked ""for at least the next two weeks"" and possibly indefinitely.

""The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,"" Zuckerberg wrote.

9xVilAmhRTS1e2PFud52Mg	"Tom Brady Shows off His 7 Super Bowl Rings: 'How It's Going'

Tom Brady is decked out in Super Bowl bling.

On Friday, the 43-year-old NFL star showed off his collection of championship rings, after receiving one for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Super Bowl LV victory earlier this year.

Brady unveiled his new bauble on social media accounts with his take on the popular ""How it started vs. How it's going"" meme, posting a throwback photo taken from his early days playing for the New England Patriots juxtaposed with a snapshot of himself wearing the seven Super Bowl rings he's won in his career thus far.

""How it started vs How it's going,"" he captioned the post.

Brady was drafted in 2000 and spent 19 years with the Patriots — during which he won six Super Bowls — before making his Buccaneers debut in 2020.

He nabbed his first championship win with the Buccaneers in February after beating out the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9.

According to the Buccaneers' website, the team's Super Bowl ring features 319 diamonds to reflect the game's final score. It also includes a twist-off removable top with the word ""HISTORIC"" laser-etched in gold, as well as a hand-engraved model of the Raymond James Stadium to commemorate the fact that the Buccaneers were the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl on their home turf.

After winning his latest Super Bowl, Brady's wife Gisele Bündchen asked, ""What more do you have to prove?""

When asked about that moment during an episode of The Late Late Show in late June, Brady candidly admitted, ""It's hard to walk away from something that you still feel like you can do and you wanna do. It's not about proving it to others what you can do, it's more about proving it to yourself.""

""And I still feel like even though I'll be 44 for this year, I still have a chance to still prove to myself that I can still do it at 44 because I really worked to a point where I can still do it at this age,"" he told host James Corden.

While Brady now has more Super Bowl rings than any player in history, he plans to continue playing football professionally until he's at least 45.

""Things change as you get older and there's a lot of different responsibilities I have in my life,"" Brady explained on Wednesday's episode of SiriusXM Town Hall. ""My kids and my family is certainly very important and they made a lot of sacrifice over a long period of time to watch me play. So, you know, I owe it to them, too.""

""I play because I love the game. I play because I love to compete,"" he said. ""We shouldn't stop our life, even though we love something because it's just, someone puts an arbitrary timeline on that.""

Brady added, ""And I felt for a long time, I could play until I was 45 years old. I think I committed to say, 'Hey, I'm going to play till I'm 45.' And this year I'll be 44, which naturally takes me to the next year. I've got a two-year contract. We'll see what happens beyond that."""
a6Q6H7m1QlGUtunw53EQbw	"Duchess Meghan wins legal fees from tabloid in privacy lawsuit; judge rejects publisher's appeal

Duchess Meghan of Sussex won a preliminary payment of about $625,000 towards her $2 million legal costs from the losing tabloid publisher in her privacy infringement lawsuit, a British judge ruled Tuesday.

But she didn't get the front-page apology she demanded. Not yet, anyway.

At a virtual hearing in London, the judge, Mark Warby, also rejected Associated Newspapers' application for permission to appeal, saying there was no real prospect of another court reaching a different conclusion.

But he said the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline still has the right to renew the application to a Court of Appeals judge.

Associated Newspapers said it would do so, as a spokesman for the publisher told The Daily Mail that it was disappointed with the judge's decision.

In a written submission to the court, Associated Newspapers' lawyer, Antony White, said his clients believe a bid to overturn Warby's ruling last month in Meghan's favor ""would have a real prospect of success.""

The hearing Tuesday was scheduled after Warby granted Meghan summary judgment in her contentious lawsuit against the tabloid and its owners for violating her privacy in February 2019, when it published five stories featuring parts of a private letter she wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, following her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry.

The hearing covered multiple issues in the aftermath of Meghan's victory in the case, including damages, legal fees and a still outstanding question about whether Meghan was the ""sole"" author of her letter to her father.

Under copyright law, the author of a private letter owns the copyright and thus her permission is needed in order to publish it. But Associated Newspapers contends that several palace officials helped Meghan write the letter. The publisher hopes to call Meghan and those officials to be cross-examined about her intentions and who else might hold authorship.

The judge set a hearing for October to take up the issue of copyright ownership.

Meghan also sought a front-page apology from the Mail on Sunday and a court order that the newspaper hand over any copies of the letter, and to destroy any electronic copies of it or any notes made about it. She also wanted all the stories about the letter to be removed from the paper's website.

Ian Mill, one of Meghan's lawyers, said in a written submission to the court that ""the defendant defiantly continues to do the very acts which the court has held are unlawful.""

The publisher's lawyers agreed to remove the articles from the website until the remaining legal issues are resolved. The judge didn't immediately rule on the request to hand over the letter."
aAwpu3yTSJWn1ySzx2JcYA	"Smit Salvage assists with Ever Given refloating effort in Suez Canal

Dutch salvor Smit Salvage has been enlisted to help refloat the grounded containership that has blocked the Suez Canal since Tuesday.

Martijn Schuttevaer, spokesman for Dutch marine services company and Smit parent company Boskalis, told Reuters late on Wednesday that it had dispatched a 10-strong team to assist with the operation.

Shipping agencies that handle canal transits reported the salvage operation that saw dredgers and tugs dispatched to the 20,388-teu Ever Given (built 2018) were suspended overnight but are set to resume on Thursday morning.

Earlier reports on Wednesday that the grounded vessel has been partially refloated and had been moored alongside the canal bank proved premature.

On Thursday morning the ship remained wedged across the southern section of the canal with tugs belonging to the Suez Canal Authority and Svitzer still in attendance.

Norwegian canal transit specialist Leth Agencies reported via Twitter late on Wednesday night that the plan for Thursday included moving the two vessels that were immediately behind the Ever Given out of the canal and back to the Suez anchorage to make room for tugs to refloat the stranded ship and tow it back to Suez.

Article continues below the advert

These ships, the 6,200-teu containership Maersk Denver (built 2007) and 63,000-dwt bulker Asia Ruby III (built 2014), were moored alongside the canal bank after the Ever Given blocked their path.

Insurance nightmare

The Shoei Kisen-owned Ever Given has protection and indemnity coverage from the UK P&I Club, while its hull and machinery is insured in the Japanese market, insurance sources told Reuters on Wednesday.

The claims total in the millions of dollars even if the ship is refloated quickly as Shoei Kisen and its insurers could face claims from the Suez Canal Authority for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage has been disrupted, they said.

There could also be claims for damage to the canal itself.

The UK P&I Club will be required to cover all third-party risks for damage caused to cargo during transit, risks of environmental damage and injuries.

So far, there have been no reports of pollution, injuries, or damage to the Ever Given's cargo.

The cost of the salvage operation is borne by the hull and machinery insurer.

The bulk of those insurance claims would then likely be reinsured through a programme run by the wider International Group of P&I"

Plus, our supportive film community and film incentives make it a great place to work.""

During the filming of ""Knight,"" street closures and simulated gunfire and explosions have been part of the production, causing a stir among locals. However, the film office and production team have worked closely to minimize disruptions and ensure the safety of the community.

Rumors have been circulating that Bruce Willis may star in ""Knight,"" but he has not been confirmed on set. Drake remained tight-lipped about the casting, only stating, ""We have a fantastic cast and crew, and I can't wait for audiences to see the finished product.""

""Knight"" is not the only production filming in the Las Cruces area this fall and winter.

(Moab Police Department) Gabrielle ""Gabby"" Petito talks to a police officer after police pulled over the van she was traveling in with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, near the entrance to Arches National Park on Aug. 12, 2021. The couple was pulled over while they were having an emotional fight. Petito was reported missing by her family a month later and her body was found on Sept. 19 near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.

According to a second body camera video released by Moab police, Gabby Petito told officers Brian Laundrie hit her — but only after she hit him.

Police stopped the pair on Aug. 12 after a 911 caller reported the two were seen fighting. Asked if Laundrie hit her, Petito replied, ""I guess. Yeah. But I hit him first.""

The officer asked Petito if she'd been hit in the face or on the arm. ""Where did he hit you?"" the officer asked. ""Don't worry, just be honest.""

""He didn't, like, hit me in the face,"" she said. ""He didn't, like, punch me in the face or anything.""

""Did he slap your face, or what?"" the officer asked.

Petito said Laundrie ""grabbed me with his nail, and I guess that's why it looks — I definitely have a cut right here,"" she said, indicating her cheek. ""I can feel it. When I touch it, it burns.""

Petito and Laundrie had been on a monthslong, cross-country road trip when police stopped them in Moab. Petito was reported missing on Sept. 11, and her body was found on Sept. 19 near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Her death has been ruled a homicide.

Laundrie, who returned to Florida without Petito on Sept. 1, has been named a ""person of interest"" in her disappearance. He disappeared after telling his parents he was going to a nature preserve. Federal investigators have issued an arrest warrant for Laundrie, who has been charged with unauthorized use of a debit card."

aQuICh5NSoKgtHhOpzT5Sg	"Bitcoin's Growing Shadow: Used for Ransom and Beyond

WASHINGTON, May 14 – Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has emerged as a formidable tool for illicit activities, including ransom demands, money laundering, and terrorism financing. Its anonymity and lack of regulation have raised concerns among government authorities, leading to heightened scrutiny and potential regulatory crackdowns on cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin's role in ransom attacks reached the spotlight in the recent Colonial Pipeline hack. The pipeline operator paid nearly $5 million in bitcoin to restore access to its computer systems, highlighting the increasing prevalence of ransomware attacks. Notable incidents from the past include the 2017 WannaCry attack that encrypted computers worldwide.

Amidst the illicit activities, bitcoin's market value has skyrocketed, recently surpassing $1 trillion with around 19 million bitcoins in circulation. The cryptocurrency is increasingly used for everyday transactions, from salaries for sports personalities to real estate purchases.

However, regulators are wary of bitcoin's anonymity, which they believe enables illegal activities. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies lack ""know your customer"" regulations that help identify and track the parties involved in transactions.

Federal investigations into potential illicit uses of cryptocurrencies are intensifying, with crypto exchange Binance facing scrutiny. The new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman, Gary Gensler, has signaled an approach toward more regulation of cryptocurrency activities.

The growing concern over bitcoin's misuse in illegal transactions has spurred regulators worldwide to consider stepping up interventions. They aim to find a balance between promoting innovation in digital currency and safeguarding it from illicit activities."

LOS ANGELES -- The script supervisor who called 911 after the fatal ""Rust"" movie-set shooting in October is the latest crew member to sue Alec Baldwin and others involved in production of the Western film.

Mamie Mitchell and her attorney Gloria Allred held a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday to detail the allegations made in the lawsuit concerning Baldwin's shooting that killed ""Rust"" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza on the New Mexico set.

Allred told reporters that no rehearsal was in progress when Baldwin drew a revolver from his holster and pointed it toward the camera. Furthermore, Mitchell's lawsuit alleges that the scenes scheduled to be rehearsed and filmed that day did not call for a gun to be discharged.

""It was not in the script. So why that happened when it was not in the script -- more evidence will need to be deduced as to why that happened. We have some information but without having it confirmed, we don't want to release it or speculate about it, but one thing is certain: That gun should not have been discharged,"" Allred said.

Serge Svetnoy says the bullet narrowly missed him and he held his close friend Halyna Hutchins as she died.

Through tears, Mitchell, who was standing next to Hutchins when she was hit, described watching the cinematographer fall to the ground and learning about her death.

""I stood in my driveway screaming. I'll never forget what happened on the set of 'Rust' that day. I relive the shooting and the sound of the explosion from the gun over and over again,"" she said. ""I'm depressed. I don't feel safe. I feel like at any moment, anything could happen to me and to those that I care about that are standing close to me.""

Mitchell was the crew member who alerted law enforcement of the shooting.

""We had two people accidentally shot on a movie set by a prop gun, we need help immediately,"" Mitchell told a 911 emergency dispatcher on Oct. 21. ""We were rehearsing and it went off, and I ran out, we all ran out.""

The dispatcher asked if the gun was loaded with a real bullet.

KENOSHA – Dominick Black, a 19-year-old from Kenosha, entered a plea of not guilty to charges related to purchasing a rifle for Kyle Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time. Black is facing two felony counts for intentionally selling a dangerous weapon to a person under 18, which led to fatal consequences.

Anthony Cotton, the attorney representing Dominick Black, has filed a request to dismiss the charges against his client. Black allegedly bought the AR-15-style rifle using money from Rittenhouse, with whom he had connections.

The weapon was acquired because Rittenhouse was underage, and it was stored at Black's stepfather's residence in Kenosha. Tragically, Rittenhouse used the rifle during protests in Kenosha on August 25, resulting in the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber.

""Given the circumstances surrounding this case, we have filed a motion to have the charges against Dominick Black dismissed,"" stated Anthony Cotton, Black's attorney.

Each charge against Black carries a punishment of up to three years in prison if convicted. In contrast, Kyle Rittenhouse is facing more severe charges, including 1st-degree intentional homicide, with his trial set to commence this fall.

The final pre-trial hearing for Dominick Black is scheduled for July 29, where further details regarding the case will likely be discussed. The events surrounding the purchase of the firearm and the subsequent tragic outcomes have drawn significant attention both locally and nationally.

The legal proceedings in this case will continue to unfold as the criminal justice system works to determine accountability for the actions that transpired on that fateful night in Kenosha."
CVokrVd6SrSvZyi_4Nh2aA	"US offers to pay families of Afghans killed in drone attack

Washington also promises to help family members who were interested to relocate to the US following botched operation.

The Pentagon has offered unspecified condolence payments to the family of 10 civilians who were killed in a botched US drone attack in Afghanistan in August during the final days before American troops withdrew from the country.

The US Department of Defense said it made a commitment that included offering ""ex-gratia condolence payments"", in addition to working with the US Department of State in support of the family members who were interested in relocation to the United States.

Colin Kahl, the US under-secretary of defense for policy, held a virtual meeting on Thursday with Steven Kwon, the founder and president of Nutrition & Education International, the aid organisation that employed Zemari Ahmadi, who was killed in the August 29 drone attack, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said late on Friday.

Ahmadi and others who were killed in the drone raid were innocent victims who bore no blame and were not affiliated with Islamic State in Khorasan Province, ISKP (ISIS-K) or threats to US forces, Kirby said.

The drone raid in Kabul killed as many as 10 civilians, including seven children.

The Pentagon had said earlier that the August 29 attack targeted an ISKP suicide bomber who posed an imminent threat to US-led troops at the airport as they completed the last stages of their withdrawal from Afghanistan.

However, reports had emerged almost immediately that the attack in a neighbourhood west of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport had killed civilians, including children.

Video from the scene showed the wreckage of a car strewn around the courtyard of a building. The Pentagon later said the raid was a ""tragic mistake"".

The attack came three days after an ISKP suicide bomber killed 13 US troops and dozens of Afghan civilians who had crowded outside the airport gates, desperate to secure seats on evacuation flights, after US-trained Afghan forces melted away and the Taliban swept to power in the capital in mid-August.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has apologised for the botched attack. However, Ahmadi's 22-year-old nephew Farshad Haidari said that was not enough.

""They must come here and apologise to us face-to-face,"" he told the AFP news agency in a bombed-out, modest house in Kwaja Burga, a densely populated neighbourhood in Kabul.

Haidari, whose brother Naser and young cousins also died in the blast, said on September 18 that the US had made no direct contact with the family.

The killing of civilians also raised questions about the future of US drone attacks in Afghanistan."

A Pennsylvania couple shot dead in a murder-suicide by their neighbor for shoveling snow into his yard have now been pictured - as it is revealed the gunman was an engineer and US Navy veteran.

James Goy, 50, and his wife, Lisa Goy, 48, were gunned down at close-range in the middle of their street in Plains Township on Monday after getting into a fight with their neighbor.

The gunman, 47-year-old Jeffrey Spaide, took his own life inside his home before police arrived at the scene.

Harrowing surveillance footage in the lead up to the shooting shows the couple screaming at Spaide from outside their home before he emerged with a handgun and fired several shots, leaving them injured.

Authorities say Spaide then went back inside his home to retrieve an AR-style rifle, which he used to execute the couple in the street.

James Goy, 50, (back left) and his wife, Lisa Goy, 48, (back right) were gunned down at close-range in the middle of their street in Plains Township, Pennsylvania, on Monday after getting into a fight with their neighbor. They are survived by their 15-year-old autistic son (middle)

An online obituary for the gunman has revealed that he had previously worked as an engineer with the US Navy, the US Army National Guard and Navy Reserve.

He had worked as a licensed engineer for more than 20 years and he most recently had worked with the Lackawanna River Basin Sewer Authority and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

The obituary did not address his cause of death, saying only that he died at his home on Monday.

Spaide was not married and he doesn't have any children, according to the obituary. He was described as a 'loving son, brother and uncle' who loved running marathons and spending time with his family.

The neighbors he shot dead are survived by their 15-year-old autistic son.

Authorities say the murder-suicide unfolded after Spaide got into an argument with the couple because they were clearing snow from their cars and dumping it on his property across the street.

The neighbors are believed to have a history and had been involved in an altercation following a storm just two months ago.

Police had no record of prior incidents between the Goys and Spaide. The gunman was also not known to police for any other matter.

During the treacherous Texas winter storm that swept across the state in mid-February, smugglers continued their dangerous cross-border activities, putting the lives of immigrants at grave risk.

""Smugglers are criminals who have no regard for human life,"" said Border Patrol Official McGoffin. ""They will abandon people in the most dangerous conditions, leaving them to fend for themselves.""

Despite the extreme cold and hazardous conditions, border patrol agents rescued over 200 immigrants and tragically discovered four deceased individuals who succumbed to the winter freeze.

One particularly harrowing incident occurred in the Big Bend Sector, Van Horn, Texas, on February 13. A woman was reportedly ""left for dead"" by her smuggler, abandoned in the unforgiving wilderness.

For nearly a week, the woman endured unimaginable hardship, hiding among rocks and taking refuge in an abandoned shed to escape the relentless cold. Her survival instincts kept her alive, but her body was severely weakened by hypothermia and frostbite.

Finally, a local rancher noticed the woman's presence on his land and alerted the Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Border patrol agents and emergency medical technicians swiftly responded, providing immediate medical attention.

""She was in very bad shape,"" McGoffin said. ""Her core body temperature was dangerously low, and she had severe frostbite on her hands and feet.""

After stabilizing the woman's condition, she was transported to a hospital for further treatment. Officials emphasized the extreme dangers of placing trust in smugglers, who often abandon individuals unable to keep up with the grueling journey.

""These smugglers are not interested in helping people,"" McGoffin said. ""They are only interested in making money, and they will do whatever it takes to get their clients across the border, even if it means putting their lives at risk.""

The woman received ""extensive medical treatment"" and was then returned to the agency for ""appropriate adjudication."" She will likely be sent back to Mexico for illegally crossing the border.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the perilous risks immigrants face when they attempt to cross the border illegally. Smugglers are ruthless individuals who exploit the desperation of those seeking a better life, often leading to tragic consequences."

enoPEq7YTJeHfsqLEahrxg	"Trump ban won't solve deeper Twitter problem: Vitriol and violence that threaten democracy

Trump ban won't solve deeper Twitter problem: Vitriol and violence that threaten democracy Twitter helped produce an uninformed, irresponsible electorate. The platform was ready‐made for Trump's simple‐minded views and hateful rhetoric.

Twitter's decision last week to permanently ban President Donald Trump from its platform is, on first blush, somewhat surprising. After all, for more than four years, Twitter has twisted itself into pretzels trying to justify why it was not banning him for clear violations of its policies (against hate and incitement to violence). It even invented a whole new set of rules about world leaders to justify its tortured decision not to ban Trump. So, historically, Twitter has been reluctant to hold Trump responsible for his speech, likely because he was their most notorious user. Simply put, Trump was good for business.

After the violent insurrection at our nation's Capitol on Wednesday, which was clearly incited by Trump, he was no longer good for business. Under growing public pressure, Twitter, like Facebook the day before, closed Trump's infamous account and issued this statement to justify its decision: ""After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.""

Twitter acted in its interest, not ours

This is a remarkable statement because it suggests, wrongly, that the threat represented by Trump is ""recent."" It is not. Twitter was right to ban Trump, but it should have done so many years ago when it was already evident that Trump's anti-democratic rhetoric posed a clear"

This article examines the disproportionate media attention given to the case of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman who was found dead and whose fiance is the primary suspect. Nicole Mckenna has highlighted the phenomenon of the 'missing white women syndrome', which is the tendency of media outlets to prioritize the cases of missing white girls and women over other demographics. Similarly, Nicole Wagon has spoken out about the lack of attention her daughters' unresolved murders have received. Social media's extensive coverage of Petito's case was unique, in part due to the consistent posting of her trip on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. These cases shed light on the need for greater attention to be given to missing Indigenous women and girls."

According to Inside Edition, the couple found a video clip of Gabby Petito's van while touring the area, which was later found on August 27.

Inside Edition also reports on the findings, such as the discovery of evidence of what may be Gabby Petito's van, which is located near the RV parking lot. The footage shows the van being driven by a male and female, with the van in the foreground.

The couple and their partner, Jen and Kyle Bethune, have said that they picked up Brian Laundrie hitchhiking in the area and found his body. According to Inside Edition, the video may have helped confirm the couple was caught.

On August 28, Inside Edition journalist Jen Bracken posted the video on Facebook, saying, ""A couple just happened to catch a video of their van in the Grand Teton National Park. It was at the location where I spotted it last night, and it has since been posted on social media.""

According to Bracken, the couple's car appears to be a Honda Civic, which the pair say they were traveling with when they spotted it. The camera shows Laundrie sitting in the backseat of the vehicle, with his driver's side mirror.

Photos of the couple's vehicle have also been shared by the National Park Service, which has confirmed that they were driving a vehicle with a registration plate that appears to be similar to the one used by Laundrie. The couple has said that their vehicle was found in the parking lot of the Grand Teton National Park on August 28, and that they believe that the van had been stolen.

""Based on this video, it sounds like they were in the clear,"" Bracken said. ""I think the couple will have a lot of reasons to explore this area in the near future.""

Bracken said that the couple is willing to cooperate with the National Park Service and cooperate with any law enforcement agencies that might have access to their van.

F9g-6KvBS5ahrXEKP_t8AA	"Right Place, Right Time: How SBK Records' 30 Months of Existence Launched 30 Years of Music Industry Leadership

News of Universal Music Group's $50 billion valuation in the wake of its recent IPO made the ""pandemic-ly retired"" Marty Bandier wistful. ""I sure wish I was in the business now,"" says the veteran music exec, who headed both EMI and Sony/ATV Music Publishing over a decades-long career. ""The prices being paid for music publishing rights are so wild.""

Indeed, 2021 marks 30 years since SBK Records, in which the ""B"" is for Bandier, was bought out by Thorne-EMI and folded into its North American Record Group, basically ending its short, but dynamic existence as a standalone label. That concluded Thorne-EMI's then-massive acquisition of the company — which began in 1989 when it bought SBK Music Publishing for a reported $300 million-plus (north of $600 million when adjusted for inflation) — which seems like a pittance today.

SBK — also named for business partners Stephen Swid, the late financier, and label and publishing titan Charles Koppelman (pictured at left) — came in hot when it launched in 1988 as an EMI-distributed ""boutique"" label. It lasted less than 30 months, but during its heyday had a checkbook that rivaled the majors' — enlisting the services of independent promoters at a time when the major labels kept their distance due to a scathing 1986 NBC report exposing commonplace payola in the records and radio business — and used it.

The label broke a series of multi-platinum records by, most notoriously, Vanilla Ice (""Ice Ice Baby""), but also Wilson-Phillips (""Hold On"") and Technotronic (""Pump Up the Jam""), while scoring hits with early albums from British alternative groups Jesus Jones and Blur, as well as Jon Secada, a sideman for Gloria and Emilio Estefan.

Even more impressive was its list of future label executives, from Glassnote president/founder Daniel Glass (pictured at right) to a fledgling A&R newcomer named Pete Ganbarg, who went on to become president of A&R at Atlantic and president of Atco. Others who passed through its glass doors include Cornerstone and the Fader cofounders Rob Stone and Jon Cohen, who were in the promotion department, along with Glass, Hilary Shaev (now Lerner), the late Neil Lasher and Ken Lane. A suit-and-jacketed Monte Lipman, future founder and steward of Republic Records, home to Drake, The Weeknd, Post Malone and many others, joined as an intern and was named a regional promotion man out of Atlanta, a rare post for a white Jewish boy from Montclair, New Jersey. In the legal department was Deborah Dugan, who would go on to become president of Disney Publishing, CEO of Bono and Bobby Shriver's (RED) non-profit, and endure a brief and controversial turn as president/ CEO of the Recording Academy.

FG3Q_N1zREiTCssdoIAlrA	"Stranded Crew Members on Drillship During Hurricane Ida to Be Evacuated

GRAND ISLE, Louisiana – Days after Hurricane Ida made landfall as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, severely impacting the Gulf Coast and particularly battering a drillship off the Louisiana coast, actions are now underway to evacuate the stranded crew members of the Noble Globetrotter II. The hurricane, which brought fierce winds and heavy rains, left several crew members injured and raised significant concerns about the decision-making of Noble Corporation, the owner of the drillship, regarding the safety of its crew.

According to relatives of the crew members, there was increasing frustration with Noble Corporation's apparent reluctance to evacuate the crew before Hurricane Ida struck. One spouse voiced their criticism directly, highlighting a perceived disregard for the wellbeing and safety of the people on board. These concerns were echoed by others as they anxiously awaited news of their loved ones.

In response to the mounting scrutiny, a representative from Noble Corporation defended the company's actions, stating, ""We took evasive actions to avoid the direct path of the storm."" Despite these claims, the severity of the hurricane's impact on the Globetrotter II prompted questions about the adequacy of those measures and whether more could have been done to ensure the safety of the crew.

The situation escalated when images of the damaged drillship began circulating, prompting the U.S. Coast Guard to initiate a rescue operation. A Coast Guard representative explained, ""Upon receiving images showing the extent of the damage to the Noble Globetrotter II, we immediately dispatched rescue operations to assist the crew in distress.""

However, during initial communications, the Coast Guard was told by Noble Corporation officials that ""the vessel was not in distress and was not actively taking on water at that time."" This statement raised further questions about the timing and urgency of the evacuation efforts.

In a subsequent announcement, Noble Corporation confirmed that all personnel on board the Noble Globetrotter II are now safe and accounted for. The company is actively arranging for some of the crew to be transported to shore, while also coordinating the replacement personnel to be brought in.

The vessel itself sustained significant damage, including to a cofferdam, a crucial component for the ship's stability. However, a Noble Corporation representative assured, ""We believe that the damage has not compromised the vessel's stability or safety."" The focus now shifts to assessing the full extent of the damage and initiating recovery operations.

Noble Corporation is currently in the process of locating and planning to recover the equipment that sank during the hurricane. The company remains optimistic about its ability to replace any missing or damaged equipment and resume operations.

As these efforts continue, the story of the Noble Globetrotter II serves as a stark reminder of the hazards faced by those who work at sea, especially during hurricane season. The ordeal has brought attention to the need for stringent safety protocols and timely decision-making, to prevent similar situations in the future.

As the Gulf Coast begins to recover from Hurricane Ida, the impact on the Noble Globetrotter II and its crew will likely spark discussions on how best to protect maritime personnel against the unpredictable and often devastating forces of nature."
fKyPpz9mSDyJeocTnpWFkw	"Tiger Woods Will Not Face Charges After Car Crash; Injuries Uncertain for Future Golf Events

Just hours after Tiger Woods' car crash in Southern California, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva confirmed that Woods will not face charges for the incident, as there was no evidence of impairment, drugs, or alcohol involved. According to Deputy Sheriff Carlos Gonzalez, Woods was ""lucid"" at the time of the accident and did not require sobriety tests.

The widely-publicized crash involving the high-profile athlete and his $50,000 Genesis GV80 SUV took place on a notorious stretch of road for its numerous accidents in Rolling Hills Estates. On February 23, Woods, who was on his way to film a TV teaching lesson, collided with a median, shearing off the entire front of the car; it then struck a tree and a signpost.

Woods suffered significant injuries, including a shattered right ankle and two leg fractures, one of which was a compound fracture. It took Los Angeles County firefighters over an hour to extricate him from the vehicle. Following his extrication, Woods was immediately transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent a lengthy surgical procedure.

""Mr. Woods was in serious condition upon arrival in our trauma center,"" explained Anish Mahajan, Chief Medical Officer of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. ""Due to the severe nature of his injuries, Dr. Samuel Adams, our trauma medical director, performed a complex surgical procedure on his right lower extremity, involving the insertion of a rod into the tibia. Additionally, a combination of screws and pins were used to stabilize the foot and ankle joints.""

This incident marks the third police investigation in which Woods has been involved regarding his driving. In 2009, Woods was involved in a car crash at his Florida residence, which led to more significant revelations about his personal life. Later, Woods was arrested in 2017 for driving under the influence of prescription medication.

As for Woods' future golf events, the extent of his injuries casts uncertainty and doubt on his ability to participate in tournaments like The Masters, which is scheduled to take place in April. While the golf world and fans alike eagerly await his recovery, it is evident that Woods has a long road ahead to fully heal.

""Mr. Woods is currently recovering and in good spirits,"" added Mahajan. ""However, his injuries are severe and will require extensive rehabilitation and recovery time.""

Sheriff Villanueva further detailed the cause of the accident, stating, ""the crash occurred because of the high speed and inability to navigate the curve and the slope leading to it.""

The golfing legend, whose career has been marked by numerous Grand Slam wins, is well-known for his resilience both on and off the course. Fans are hopeful that this strength will aid him in his latest challenge.

The vehicle, a $50,000 Genesis GV80 SUV, sustained extensive front-end damage and was towed off the scene. Woods' representatives and the rental company have not yet made any statements regarding the incident.

In 2019, Woods made a remarkable comeback at The Masters, an accomplishment that many believed to be one of his most impressive feats in the sport. The golfing community and fans around the world are eager to see Woods return to the green. However, it is unclear at this time if and when that might occur.

Concern for Woods has come in from all corners of the globe, with fans and fellow golfers alike wishing him a swift recovery. The legendary golfer's impact on the sport is undeniable, as he has garnered legions of new fans over the course of his highly successful professional career.

As Woods continues his recovery, his many fans express hope that the golfing legend will soon return to the sport he loves. Despite the adversity he faces, Woods' perseverance and determination remain unshaken, just as they have been throughout his remarkable career."
Fn43opdUQU-L6dxXolUvaQ	"Australia passes new media law that will require Google, Facebook to pay for news

Australia has passed a new law that will require digital platforms like Facebook and Google to pay local media outlets and publishers to link their content on news feeds or in search results. The move was widely expected and comes days after the government introduced some last-minute amendments to the proposed bill, known officially as the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code. ""The Code will ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate, helping to sustain public interest journalism in Australia,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said in a joint statement. They added that the government was ""pleased to see progress by both Google and more recently Facebook in reaching commercial arrangements with Australian news media businesses."" The law will be reviewed by the Treasury within one year of its commencement, the officials said.

What did Facebook and Google do?

Both Facebook and Google have fought against the law since last year. Essentially, Australia will become the first country where a government-appointed arbitrator can decide on the final price that either platform will have to pay Australian news publishers, provided a commercial deal cannot be reached independently. The decision will come by a ruling in favor of either party — the digital platform or the publisher — with no room for a middle-ground agreement, according to experts. In this week's amendments, the government said the parties involved will get a two-month mediation period to broker deals before they are made to enter arbitration as a last resort.

Facebook announced Monday it will restore news pages in Australia, reversing an earlier decision to block access to news content on in Australia in retaliation against the then proposed bill. Facebook's vice president for global news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said Tuesday the Australian government clarified that the tech company will retain the ability to decide if news appears on its platform so that it won't automatically be subject to a forced negotiation. Google initially threatened to pull its search function from Australia. In recent weeks, however, it struck a number of prominent commercial agreements with Australian publishers, including the Murdoch family-owned media conglomerate NewsCorp.

FUcmGFfyTDCAkfOjIwsztg	"Bob Costas Reflects on Muhammad Ali's Timeless Olympic Moment: 'A Beautiful Figure in a Brutal Sport'

Bob Costas, the esteemed sportscaster with a career spanning over four decades, fondly remembers one of the most iconic moments in sports history: Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic cauldron at the 1996 Atlanta Games. As Costas gears up for the premiere of his new HBO show Back on the Record, he takes a moment to reminisce about the unforgettable appearance of the legendary boxer, who passed away in 2016.

""That was a moment that transcended sports,"" Costas told PEOPLE. ""It wasn't just a great moment in the Olympics; it was a great moment in American history, maybe even world history.""

The surprise appearance by Ali, who had been battling Parkinson's disease for over 30 years, was masterfully orchestrated by Dick Ebersol, then the head of NBC Sports. Ebersol intentionally kept Costas and his cohost Dick Enberg in the dark to capture their genuine reactions on air. ""Dick Ebersol knew the power of that moment, and he wanted it to be unfiltered,"" Costas recalled.

As Ali emerged from the shadows, the stadium erupted with a collective gasp, followed by a thunderous ovation. The emotions in the air were a mix of excitement, awe, and a deep sense of poignancy. For Costas, it was a testament to Ali's enduring impact. ""It was a moment of reconciliation for Ali,"" he said. ""People recognized that, despite his polarizing past, he had earned their respect and admiration.""

Costas, who has covered numerous Olympic events, asserts that Ali's appearance stands out as the most emotionally charged moment of his career. ""There have been other great Olympic moments, but I've never experienced anything quite like that,"" he shared. ""It was a convergence of grace, courage, and history.""

Ali's ability to captivate and inspire an audience, even in his physically challenged state, left an indelible mark on Costas. ""He was a blend of grace and wit,"" Costas mused. ""Muhammad Ali had this unique ability to move people in a way that few others could.""

As Costas embarks on a new chapter with Back on the Record, the memory of Ali serves as a reminder of the power of sports to unite and inspire. ""Muhammad Ali was a beautiful figure in a brutal sport,"" Costas said. ""His legacy lives on, not just in the annals of boxing, but in the hearts of those who witnessed that unforgettable night in Atlanta.""

The enduring image of Ali lighting the Olympic cauldron remains a beacon of hope and resilience, a testament to the power of the human spirit. And for Bob Costas, it's a moment that will forever be etched in his heart and in the annals of sports history."
guzrnqp0RiSnDmoDNwCyvQ	"Meta to Discontinue Facial Recognition Software and Delete Associated Data Amid Privacy Concerns

CNN Business – In a move aimed at addressing growing privacy concerns, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, announced plans to discontinue its facial recognition software and delete the data associated with over a billion people's faces. The decision comes as the tech giant faces increased scrutiny over the potential real-world harms of its platforms, following a whistleblower's leak.

Jerome Pesenti, Meta's Vice President of Artificial Intelligence, stated in a blog post, ""Given ongoing concerns about the use of facial recognition technology, we have decided not to renew our Morrissey data agreement when it expires, and to delete the associated face recognition template data we have received. This is another step in our ongoing efforts to address feedback from civil society, regulators, and experts.""

The move was welcomed by privacy advocates, including Woodrow Hartzog, a professor at Northeastern University specializing in law and computer science. Hartzog told CNN Business, ""This is a victory for privacy advocacy. Facial recognition technology raises significant privacy risks, and the deletion of this data is a step in the right direction.""

Critics argue that facial recognition technology, which can automatically identify people in photos and videos, has the potential for significant inaccuracies and racial bias. Caitlin Seeley George, Campaign Director at Fight for the Future, emphasized these concerns, stating, ""Facial recognition technology is a threat to our privacy and civil liberties, and it's particularly harmful to communities of color, who are disproportionately impacted by these systems.""

Facebook's facial recognition feature, which allowed over 643 million users to opt-in, was a significant driver of user engagement on the platform. However, concerns about the technology's accuracy and potential for misuse have led to increased regulatory scrutiny and public pressure.

Despite the decision to discontinue the facial recognition software, Meta may still explore the use of facial recognition technology in future products. Pesenti noted, ""We remain subject to ongoing civil and criminal investigations and regulatory inquiries, and we will continue to work on these issues.""

The implications of Meta's decision could extend beyond the tech industry, as other companies and industries explore the use of facial recognition technology. Hartzog commented, ""This decision by Meta could have a ripple effect on the use of facial recognition technology more broadly. Other companies might follow suit if they see that the public is becoming increasingly skeptical of this technology.""

The use of facial recognition technology has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that its benefits for identity verification and fraud prevention outweigh the risks. However, cases of wrongful arrests based on faulty facial recognition data have highlighted the potential for significant harm.

Meta's decision to discontinue its facial recognition software and delete associated data represents a significant shift in the company's approach to privacy concerns. As the debate over the use of facial recognition technology continues, it remains to be seen how other companies and regulators will respond.

Pesenti concluded, ""We believe that transparency, accountability, and control are essential components of a responsible approach to facial recognition technology. We look forward to continuing our engagement with civil society, regulators, and experts on these important issues."""
H8GaiIixQGKBXcnucRVCAA	"Fact Check: Biden's Inauguration Crowd Size and Its Implications

In the aftermath of Joe Biden's inauguration as the 46th President of the United States, social media was abuzz with comparisons between the size of his crowd and that of his predecessor, Donald Trump. These comparisons sparked controversy and fueled baseless claims that Trump actually won the 2020 election. This fact-checking article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of these claims and the factors that contributed to the differences in crowd sizes.

The Crowd Size Controversy

Social media posts comparing the crowd sizes at Biden's and Trump's inaugurations went viral, with many users claiming that the smaller turnout at Biden's event indicated widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. However, these claims are simply not supported by facts.

Official Restrictions Due to COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in shaping the size and nature of Biden's inauguration. In contrast to Trump's inauguration in 2017, which took place before the pandemic, Biden's event was subject to strict health and safety protocols to mitigate the spread of the virus.

Tony Allen, the Chief Executive Officer of the inaugural committee, explained that the decision to limit the number of in-person attendees was made in consultation with public health experts. ""The pandemic required us to make some difficult decisions about the size and scope of the inauguration,"" he said. ""We prioritized the health and safety of all participants and attendees.""

Virtual Participation Encouraged

To ensure public safety, the inaugural committee strongly encouraged virtual participation in the event. This included live streaming the ceremony on various platforms, allowing millions of Americans to witness the historic occasion from the comfort of their homes.

Reduced Ticket Allocations for Members of Congress

Members of Congress typically receive a significant number of tickets to distribute for presidential inaugurations. However, due to the pandemic-related restrictions, the number of tickets allocated to lawmakers was drastically reduced for Biden's inauguration. This further contributed to the smaller crowd size.

Increased Security Measures

The events of January 6, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, necessitated heightened security measures for Biden's inauguration. This included the deployment of the National Guard and the closure of several subway stations in the vicinity of the Capitol. These measures were necessary to ensure the safety of attendees and prevent any potential disruptions.

Mayor Bowser's Appeal for Virtual Participation

Following the Capitol riot, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser urged people to watch the inauguration virtually. ""We are asking people not to come to Washington, D.C., to participate in the inaugural activities,"" she said. ""We want to avoid large crowds and potential violence.""

No Evidence of Widespread Voter Fraud

It is crucial to emphasize that election officials and courts, including the Supreme Court, have repeatedly found no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. President Joe Biden won the election with more than 7 million votes over Donald Trump.

Conclusion

The claims that Joe Biden's small inauguration crowd size proves Donald Trump won the 2020 election are baseless and not supported by facts. The pandemic-related restrictions, virtual participation, reduced ticket allocations, increased security measures, and Mayor Bowser's appeal for virtual participation all contributed to the smaller crowd size. The 2020 election results have been repeatedly affirmed by election officials and courts, with no evidence of widespread voter fraud."

After weeks of negotiation, the Ever Given has finally been pulled out of the Suez Canal and is no longer stranded in the Mediterranean Sea. It is now free to sail on July 7.

The SCA's decision was reached after weeks of negotiations, and the deal is now officially binding. The SCA has offered to allow the Ever Given to sail on July 7.

If the Ever Given ships continue to be stuck in the canal indefinitely, it will become an economic burden on Shoei Kisen, and possibly ruin the entire international shipping industry. With this settlement, the United States and China will have to impose tariffs on their shipping companies to prevent this from happening again.

In the meantime, Shoei Kisen has said it will work with all the relevant parties to try to resolve the dispute peacefully. The deal can be reviewed in the coming months and will be signed into law on July 7.

Overall, the Ever Given and Shoei Kisen have been successful in their attempts to negotiate, but they have been unable to put aside their differences and make a deal that will ultimately benefit both sides.

The Ever Given, which is owned by Shoei Kisen, is currently blocking the Suez Canal in protest over the lack of work. It has demanded a formal settlement for the ship and its crew since it was dislodged on March 29. The settlement agreement will allow the Ever Given to sail on July 7, and as a result, Shoei Kisen and its insurers will be able to continue working with Shoei Kisen.

The U.S. military temporarily froze all flights out of Hamid Karzai International Airport on Monday as anger and desperation rose among Afghans during the Taliban takeover. The decision came after a crowd chased a departing C-17 airlifter down the runway and unknown gunmen twice shot at U.S. troops at the airport.

Airlift operations on the military side of the airport resumed by late Monday, allowing several additional military aircraft to land, though the civilian side remained closed.

""There are no flights coming or going, military or civilian, and this is because of large crowds that are still on the tarmac, on the southern side of the field, the civilian side of the field,"" Kirby said before U.S. troops restored enough order for planes to operate.

So far, the Taliban has not attacked the airport, even as their forces entered other government facilities in the capital city. The head of U.S. Central Command Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie has been in direct talks with the Taliban in Doha, Kirby confirmed.

""He issued a very clear and unambiguous warning that any attack on our operations and our people would be met with a forceful response,"" Kirby said.

A Taliban spokesman said on MSNBC on Monday that the group has told U.S. officials that they will not attack Americans as they move into Kabul. Suhail Shaheen also said the Taliban will not block anyone from leaving Afghanistan, including those who helped the U.S. or Afghan governments.

""We will not punish them...will not pose arrest to them, their property, or their life,"" Shaheen said. ""They are welcome"" to go.

A video posted to Twitter on Monday purported to show a departing C-17 mobbed by hundreds of young men, some trying to cling to the plane as it took off. Later videos posted to Twitter showed bodies falling from the plane as it ascended.

Kirby said he could not confirm the authenticity of the later videos but said the lack of security around the jets was the reason flights have been temporarily halted.

""We obviously don't want anyone else to get hurt,"" he said.

Kirby said U.S. forces had been shot at and returned fire in two separate incidents, killing two people. He said he had no further details.

The number of U.S. troops in or heading to Kabul to protect the U.S. evacuation has risen to about 6,000, Kirby said. That includes the roughly 1,000 troops of the last of three 82nd Airborne Division battalions rerouted from their previous destination of Kuwait. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered that final battalion redirected on Monday because of the increased desperation of Afghans trying to flee the Taliban, Kirby said.

About 500 troops were expected to arrive in Kabul on Monday.

Once evacuation flights resume, the U.S. should be able ""to get 5,000 [people] or maybe even more out per day on literally a couple dozen or more sorties per day,"" Kirby said.

The military is also ramping up to house up to 22,000 Afghan special immigration visa applicants and their families and other Afghans they identify as ""vulnerable"" under Taliban rule at bases across the United States.

How long will these new U.S. forces stay?

President Joe Biden had directed troops to be fully withdrawn by Aug. 31, and that is still the goal, Kirby said — adding that the changing security situation on the ground could affect that."
i5ii1Zw-Th2aiTAm8uDlOA	"Twitter purged more than 70,000 accounts affiliated with QAnon following Capitol riot

Twitter said late Monday it purged more than 70,000 accounts affiliated with conspiracy theory QAnon following the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol last week. Twitter said in a blog post that it removed the accounts ""to protect the conversation on our service from attempts to incite violence, organize attacks, and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome."" The company said it began suspending the accounts on Friday afternoon, citing an increased risk of harm between online speech and real-world events.

Twitter's purge Monday marked its latest effort to combat the rise of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that loosely revolves around the idea that an anonymous government official, known as Q, wages war against the so-called deep state that has sought to undermine President Trump. Trump himself in the past has amplified accounts tied to QAnon, helping to further its rise.

The crackdown came on a day when Amazon, Twitter and other tech companies confronted fresh blowback for a slew of other efforts to try to tackle harmful content online — including decisions to ban Trump and a wide array of websites that had glorified the violent mob that stormed the Capitol last week.

Twitter's decision to remove Trump's account, citing the potential that his corrosive rhetoric might incite additional violence, precipitated a sharp drop in the company's shares, which fell by more than 6 percent Monday. Twitter also braced for a potential protest outside its San Francisco headquarters, a demonstration that the president's supporters have sought to organize on pro-Trump forums in recent days. And leaders at both Facebook and Twitter advised employees to lower their social media profiles because some workers had received security and death threats.

Amazon, meanwhile, faced a new lawsuit from Parler, an alternative social network that had become a haven for Trump's backers. Amazon Web Services, which provides cloud computing services, suspended its relationship with Parler starting Monday in a move that removed it from the Web — prompting Parler to allege that Amazon had acted unlawfully. Amazon shares also dipped slightly by afternoon.

(Amazon chief executive and founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

The flurry of activity reflected the still-intensifying clash between Washington and Silicon Valley in the days since Trump's incendiary comments about the 2020 election helped spark the riot that forced the U.S. Capitol into lockdown and left five people dead.

Late Friday, Twitter banned Trump, citing two tweets, including one that said he is not planning to attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. Facebook earlier in the week also said it was suspending Trump indefinitely, and Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that there are ""no plans to lift"" the ban.

Twitter continued its efforts over the weekend, purging tens of thousands of accounts affiliated with the QAnon conspiracy"
j8hS6c6cR1G-1K37b2-hHg	"Remarks by President Biden on the Verdict in the Derek Chauvin Trial for the Death of George Floyd

Today, a jury in Minnesota found former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all counts in the murder of George Floyd last May.

It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism the Vice President just referred to — the systemic racism that is a stain our nation's soul; the knee on the neck of justice for Black Americans; the profound fear and trauma, the pain, the exhaustion that Black and brown Americans experience every single day.

The murder of George Floyd launched a summer of protest we hadn't seen since the Civil Rights era in the '60s — protests that unified people of every race and generation in peace and with purpose to say, ""Enough. Enough. Enough of the senseless killings.""

Today — today's verdict is a step forward. I just spoke with the Governor of Minnesota, who thanked me for the close work with his team.

And I also just spoke with George Floyd's family again — a remarkable family of extraordinary courage. Nothing can ever bring their brother, their father back. But this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America.

Let's also be clear that such a verdict is also much too rare. For so many people, it seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors: a brave young woman with a smartphone camera; a crowd that was traumatized — traumatized witnesses; a murder that lasts almost 10 minutes in broad daylight for, ultimately, the whole world to see; officers standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks, which should be commended; a jury who heard the evidence, carried out their civic duty in the midst of an extraordinary moment, under extraordinary pressure.

For so many, it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver a just — just basic accountability.

We saw how traumatic and exhausting just watching the trial was for so many people. Think about it, those of you who are listening — think about how traumatic it was for you. You weren't there. You didn't know any of the people.

But it was difficult, especially for the witnesses who had to relive that day.

It's a trauma on top of the fear so many people of color live with every day when they go to sleep at night and pray for the safety of themselves and their loved ones.

Again — as we saw in this trial, from the fellow police officers who testified — most men and women who wear the badge serve their communities honorably.

But those few who fail to meet that standard must be held accountable. And they were today; one was. No one should be above the law. And today's verdict sends that message.

But it is not enough. We can't stop here."
jCTgzoVPSNif-QA8m2REIg	"U.S. VP Harris forges on with Vietnam trip despite mystery 'health incident'

HANOI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris pushed ahead with a trip to Vietnam on Tuesday after delaying the visit over concerns due to a health incident potentially related to the mysterious Havana syndrome.

Harris arrived in the Southeast Asian country's capital after a three-hour delay in Singapore that the U.S. government blamed on reports that someone in Hanoi may have been targeted by the Havana syndrome, a condition of unknown origin with symptoms including dizziness, nausea, migraines and memory lapses.

The incident upstaged a bid by President Joe Biden's top deputy to woo the allies Washington hopes will help it challenge China's assertive foreign policy in the region.

Beijing, meanwhile, attempted to stage its own diplomatic coup with a surprise meeting in Vietnam and a donation of 2 million COVID-19 vaccines to the country.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Havana syndrome case was reported in Vietnam before Harris' departure but not confirmed. A safety assessment was done before sending Harris to the country, she said.

""The Vice President's office was made aware of a report of a recent possible anomalous health incident in Hanoi,"" the local U.S. Embassy said.

Some 200 U.S. officials and kin, including CIA officers, have been sickened by ""Havana syndrome,"" CIA Director William Burns has said.

A U.S. National Academy of Sciences panel in December found that a plausible theory is that ""directed energy"" beams caused the syndrome, which is so named because it first was reported by American officials based in the U.S. embassy in Cuba in 2016.

The CIA sees a ""very strong possibility"" that the syndrome is intentionally caused, and that Russia could be responsible, but is withholding definitive conclusions pending further investigation. Moscow denies involvement."
JkXbGQIbRI-afEarfQxMJA	"Former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin Pleads Guilty in Federal Court to Depriving George Floyd and a Minor Victim of Their Constitutional Rights

The Justice Department announced today that Derek Chauvin, 45, pleaded guilty in federal court to two violations of a federal civil rights statute.

First, defendant Chauvin pleaded guilty to willfully depriving, while acting under color of law, George Floyd of his constitutional rights, resulting in Mr. Floyd's bodily injury and death. Defendant Chauvin also agreed that the appropriate sentencing base offense level for this crime is second-degree murder because he used unreasonable and excessive force that resulted in Mr. Floyd's death, and he acted willfully and in callous and wanton disregard of the consequences to Mr. Floyd's life.

Second, defendant Chauvin pleaded guilty to willfully depriving, while acting under color of law, a then 14-year-old juvenile of his constitutional rights, resulting in the juvenile's bodily injury.

""Defendant Chauvin has pleaded guilty to two federal civil rights violations, one of which led to the tragic loss of George Floyd's life,"" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. ""While recognizing that nothing can repair the harm caused by such acts, the Justice Department is committed to holding accountable those who violate the Constitution, and to safeguarding the civil rights of all Americans.""

In the plea agreement, defendant Chauvin admitted that on May 25, 2020, he willfully violated Mr. Floyd's constitutional right to be free from an officer's use of unreasonable force. Specifically, defendant Chauvin admitted that he held his left knee across Mr. Floyd's neck, back and shoulder and his right knee on Mr. Floyd's back and arm. The plea agreement states that Mr. Floyd remained restrained, prone and handcuffed on the ground for approximately 10 minutes. Defendant Chauvin further admitted that he continued to use force even though he was aware that Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting, talking and moving, and even though he was aware that Mr. Floyd had lost consciousness and a pulse. Defendant Chauvin admitted that Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) policy and training requires officers to stop using force when a subject is not resisting and to move an arrestee from the prone position into a side recovery or seated position because the prone position may make it more difficult to breathe. Defendant Chauvin admitted that his willful use of unreasonable force resulted in Mr. Floyd's bodily injury and death because his actions impaired Mr. Floyd's ability to obtain and maintain sufficient oxygen to sustain"
JPZxxPj5SHKp9etv-FaOGA	"White House Announces $1.7 Billion Investment from American Rescue Plan to Battle COVID-19 Variants

The Biden Administration has unveiled a significant $1.7 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan to bolster the nation's efforts in detecting, monitoring, and mitigating the spread of COVID-19 variants. This strategic allocation of funds underscores the commitment to safeguarding public health and strengthening the country's response capabilities against emergent mutations of the virus.

A key aspect of this investment is the enhancement of the nation's genomic sequencing capacity, a critical tool in identifying and combating potentially dangerous COVID-19 variants. Prior to this investment, the United States was sequencing approximately 8,000 COVID-19 strains weekly. With the new funding, these efforts have significantly expanded, enabling a more robust and rapid response to potential threats.

Of the $1.7 billion, $1 billion is designated to expand genomic sequencing across the country, empowering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), states, and other jurisdictions to improve their ability to identify and monitor COVID-19 mutations effectively. This allocation will ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the virus's evolution, enabling targeted interventions and public health policies.

An additional $400 million has been set aside to establish Centers of Excellence in Genomic Epidemiology. These centers will foster collaboration between state health departments and academic institutions, fostering innovative research and the development of cutting-edge surveillance tools. By bridging the gap between academia and public health, these centers will contribute to a more agile and informed response to future outbreaks.

Furthermore, $300 million will be dedicated to building and supporting a National Bioinformatics Infrastructure. This investment will upgrade data systems and enhance analytical capabilities, allowing for proactive prevention and early detection of virus spread and mutations. The improved infrastructure will streamline the sharing of vital data among researchers, public health officials, and healthcare providers, fostering a more coordinated national response.

The funding also aims to achieve broader geographic coverage of genomic sequencing, ensuring that emergent threats can be identified and addressed more quickly, regardless of location. This comprehensive approach will facilitate the rapid collection of COVID-19 specimens, the sequencing of viruses, and the timely sharing of crucial data with relevant stakeholders.

The Centers of Excellence in Genomic Epidemiology and the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure will play pivotal roles in advancing the understanding of COVID-19 and its variants, while also setting the stage for more effective surveillance and response strategies in the face of future public health challenges.

In conclusion, the Biden Administration's $1.7 billion investment in genomic sequencing and related infrastructure is a testament to the commitment to protecting the American people from the evolving threats posed by COVID-19 variants. By strengthening the nation's ability to detect, monitor, and respond to these mutations, the United States is better equipped to save lives, reduce the spread of the virus, and ultimately end the pandemic."
KaSDoZC9Qd-MpQV5DgbAwg	"Witness Recounts Chaotic Scene Involving Gabby Petito and Fiancé Before Her Disappearance

On August 27, Nina Celie Angelo witnessed a disturbing altercation involving Gabby Petito and her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, at a restaurant in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. According to Angelo, Laundrie was yelling at the restaurant's staff, including a hostess, waitress, and manager, all of whom were women. Petito was observed standing on the sidewalk, crying, during the incident.

The restaurant, Merry Piglets, confirmed the presence of Petito and Laundrie on the day in question but provided no further details. Angelo's boyfriend, Matthew England, later connected the incident at the restaurant to a couple he had seen arguing in online bodycam footage involving police from Moab, Utah.

Angelo reported the incident to legal authorities in hopes of aiding the investigation into Petito's disappearance. Gabby Petito was reported missing on September 11, after Laundrie returned from their road trip without her on September 1. Petito's body was found on September 19, and her death was ruled a homicide by the FBI on September 21.

Brian Laundrie has been named a 'person of interest' in Petito's case but had not been charged with any crimes by the time of reporting. Laundrie has not been seen since September 14, leading to a major search in the 24,500-acre Carlton wildlife reserve.

Angelo's account of the incident at the restaurant provides a chilling glimpse into the events leading up to Petito's disappearance. The fact that Laundrie was yelling at women at the restaurant raises concerns about his behavior and treatment of women.

The investigation into Petito's disappearance and death continues, with law enforcement agencies working tirelessly to uncover the truth. Angelo's account of the incident at the restaurant is an important piece of the puzzle, and it is hoped that it will help lead to justice for Gabby Petito and her family."
KGAtPCXtSJqucMb-p7i2ng	"Kamala Harris grapples with unique challenges as vice president

Four months into her time as vice president, Kamala Harris is still finding her footing in the role.

Harris is seen as a major reason why President Biden won the White House, and she's considered an heir apparent for the Democratic nomination in 2024 or 2028.

But she has struggled to break through as she juggles an evolving portfolio, adapts to a new staff and builds a relationship with Biden, who has a completely different style than her own.

""I don't think it's been as seamless as it appears,"" said one Democrat who has spoken to aides in the White House about the matter. ""There have been some growing pains and learning curves across the board.""

Harris is constantly by Biden's side when he makes announcements or holds meetings and has herself phoned at least a dozen foreign leaders, according to a White House official.

She's hit the road to sell Biden's agenda and used her platform to address vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans. The White House has put Harris at the center of its efforts to ensure equity in the coronavirus response and Biden's American Jobs Plan. The White House announced earlier this month that she would also lead the National Space Council.

Behind the scenes, however, some Democrats have grumbled that Harris is attached to Biden's side at major public events but hasn't paved her own path.

""It feels more like she's an extension of staff, like a chief of staff,"" said one strategist close to the White House. ""It seems like they go back and forth on whether they want that to be the case. It's clear that they kind of don't know what to do with her.""

Harris occupies a unique role as vice president, one with few if any parallels in modern history.

There are the historic firsts: She is the first woman, the first Black person and the first Indian American to be vice president.

She is also the first vice president in a long time who might become her party's nominee four years after the election of the president for which she serves — and when that president is eligible to serve another term.

Biden, 78, has said he plans to run for president in 2024, but his age will continue to cause people to wonder if Harris will actually be the nominee. That puts Harris in a difficult position, not wanting to overshadow Biden and not wanting to be seen as someone eyeing his job and thinking only of her next position.

It's a problem that may be exacerbated by Harris's natural political charisma and Biden's own more low-key public persona. There was never a question of Biden overshadowing former President Obama when he served as vice president for two terms. But it's at least possible with Biden and Harris given their historic roles and personalities.

Anita McBride, who served as an assistant to President George W. Bush and chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, said she thinks Harris is keeping with tradition in the role.

""She is in that support role to the president. She is not stepping out of line,"" McBride said. ""It appears clear to me she knows who is No. 1 and as most vice presidents who know what their lot is when they take this position — it's the president first and you're there to do what the president"

PAXLOVIDTM (PF-07321332; ritonavir) was found to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% compared to placebo in non-hospitalized high-risk adults with COVID-19

In the overall study population through Day 28, no deaths were reported in patients who received PAXLOVIDTM as compared to 10 deaths in patients who received placebo

PAXLOVIDTM Pfizer plans to submit the data as part of its ongoing rolling submission to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as soon as possible

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced its investigational novel COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate,PAXLOVIDTM, significantly reduced hospitalization and death, based on an interim analysis of the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis showed an 89% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint); 0.8% of patients who received PAXLOVIDTM were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (3/389 hospitalized with no deaths), compared to 7.0% of patients who received placebo and were hospitalized or died (27/385 hospitalized with 7 subsequent deaths). The statistical significance of these results was high (p<0.0001). Similar reductions in COVID-19-related hospitalization or death were observed in patients treated within five days of symptom onset; 1.0% of patients who received PAXLOVIDTM were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (6/607 hospitalized, with no deaths), compared to 6.7% of patients who received a placebo (41/612 hospitalized with 10 subsequent deaths), with high statistical significance (p<0.0001). In the overall study population through Day 28, no deaths were reported in patients who received PAXLOVIDTM as compared to 10 (1.6%) deaths in patients who received placebo.

At the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pfizer will cease further enrollment into the study due to the overwhelming efficacy demonstrated in these results and plans to submit the data as part of its ongoing rolling submission to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as soon as possible.

""Today's news is a real game-changer in the global efforts to halt the devastation of this pandemic. These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved or authorized by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients' lives, reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of ten hospitalizations,"" said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. ""Given the continued global impact of COVID-19, we have remained laser-focused on the science and fulfilling our responsibility to help healthcare systems and institutions around the world while ensuring equitable and broad access to people everywhere."""
L4BJ-c8xSzuVw_O45hnWNQ	"Vice President Harris Delivers Remarks on Supporting Working Families, Lauds Treasury Report on Childcare Economics

Washington, D.C. - Vice President Kamala Harris today emphasized the critical role of supporting working families in America, drawing attention to the Biden-Harris administration's determined efforts to address their pressing needs. Speaking at the Treasury Department, Harris highlighted the release of a comprehensive report titled ""The Economics of Childcare,"" which lays bare the challenges and exorbitant costs of childcare for countless American families.

""The Treasury Department plays an indispensable role in implementing policies that directly affect the lives of everyday Americans,"" Harris asserted. ""And the American Rescue Plan, among other initiatives, is a testament to this administration's unwavering commitment to bolstering our nation's families and restoring our economy.""

Harris expressed deep concern over the mass exodus of women from the workforce during the pandemic, describing it as a national emergency that has disproportionately impacted women. ""This is not merely a women's issue; it is an economic issue, and it is a national issue,"" she declared.

The Vice President underscored the paramount importance of bringing women back into the workforce, emphasizing its vital significance for the future of our country and the vigor of our economy. She cited compelling evidence indicating that increasing female workforce participation could lead to a substantial boost in GDP.

""We must confront the systemic barriers that have long hindered women's full participation in the workforce,"" Harris asserted. ""And one of the most glaring barriers is the lack of affordable, accessible childcare.""

Harris stressed the urgent need for substantial public investment in the childcare industry to make it more affordable and convenient for working families. She lauded the Treasury Department's comprehensive report on ""The Economics of Childcare,"" which meticulously documents the challenges and high costs of childcare for countless American families.

""This report is a clarion call to action,"" Harris declared. ""It compels us to address the insufficient public investment in early childhood education in the United States, which lags far behind other developed nations.""

The Vice President called on Congress to swiftly enact the Build Back Better agenda, a transformative legislative package that aims to extend the Child Tax Credit, expand paid family leave, and lower childcare costs. She articulated a deeply personal anecdote to underscore the profound significance of accessible childcare, recounting how her mother relied on a dedicated childcare provider to pursue her own career.

""Investing in childcare is not simply a matter of economics; it is a matter of equity and justice,"" Harris affirmed. ""It is an investment in our children, in our families, and in the future of our nation.""

Harris concluded by introducing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to deliver remarks on the critical importance of supporting working families and the Biden-Harris administration's unwavering commitment to addressing their needs.

""Secretary Yellen has been a tireless advocate for working families throughout her illustrious career,"" Harris said. ""Her deep understanding of economics and unwavering commitment to social justice make her uniquely qualified to lead the Treasury Department in these challenging times.""

Secretary Yellen took to the podium and delivered a powerful address, further elaborating on the imperative of investing in childcare and supporting working families. She emphasized the need for sustained collaboration between the Treasury Department and other agencies to implement policies that promote economic growth and shared prosperity.

""We must continue to work tirelessly to build an economy that works for everyone,"" Yellen asserted. ""An economy where working families have the support they need to thrive and where every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.""

The speeches by Vice President Harris and Treasury Secretary Yellen were met with enthusiastic applause and a resounding call to action. The Biden-Harris administration remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting working families and ensuring a brighter future for all Americans."
lellPq1fQ4mJW_eAXDp6fQ	"Reflections on Afghanistan: Balancing Idealism with Reality in the Aftermath of the U.S. Invasion

In the early days following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the author, alongside then-Senator Joe Biden, embarked on a poignant visit to witness the dire conditions in the war-torn country firsthand. As they arrived in Kabul, the capital's infrastructure lay in ruins, and the central government teetered on the brink of financial collapse. While Biden stayed at the newly reopened U.S. Embassy, the author found lodging at a modest house rented by The New York Times, symbolizing the stark differences in resources and influence.

During their visit, the pair was confronted with heart-wrenching scenes of poverty and desperation, particularly at the old Soviet Embassy where refugees languished in squalid conditions. The author grappled with conflicting emotions, torn between a deep urge to immediately alleviate Afghanistan's suffering and the intricate tribal and political complexities that permeated the country's landscape.

In a meeting with Yunus Qanooni, the Minister of the Interior for the Interim Government, an unsettling observation was made as a tribal leader's picture took precedence over that of the interim president. This stark display of tribalism underscored the daunting task of establishing a unified and neutral central government in a nation deeply divided along tribal lines, raising doubts about the feasibility of such an endeavor.

Amidst the hardships and intricate political dynamics, the author felt a resolute moral obligation for the U.S. to aid Afghanistan in its journey towards stability and security. This experience illuminated the arduous balance between the idealistic desire to offer assistance and the harsh realities unfolding on the ground, underscoring the complex nature of international intervention in conflict-ridden regions.

The firsthand account of the early days of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan paints a vivid portrait of the challenges faced by the international community in navigating through a web of tribal allegiances, political rivalries, and socioeconomic disparities. It serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring complexities entrenched within nations rebuilding from conflict, shedding light on the intricate interplay between humanitarian aspirations and the pragmatic considerations inherent in post-war reconstruction efforts.

As the world continues to grapple with the aftermath of interventions in conflict zones, the reflections from the author's visit to Afghanistan offer invaluable insights into the delicate balancing act between noble intentions and the intricate realities on the ground. In the quest for sustainable peace and stability, understanding and navigating these complexities will be paramount for forging a path forward in war-torn regions seeking to rebuild and heal."

LONDON (AP) — Buckingham Palace said Tuesday that allegations of racism made earlier this week by Prince Harry and Meghan were ""concerning"" and would be addressed privately by the royal family.

The comments, made in a statement issued on behalf Queen Elizabeth II, are the first from the palace since the two-hour television interview with Meghan and Harry rocked the royal family. Meghan, who is biracial, said the palace had failed to help her when she had suicidal thoughts and that an unidentified member of the royal family had raised ""concerns"" about the color of her baby's skin when she was pregnant with her son, Archie.

""The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,"" the palace said. ""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.''

The interview, conducted by Oprah Winfrey and which aired Sunday night in the U.S. and a day later in Britain, has divided people around the world. While many say the allegations demonstrate the need for change inside a palace that hasn't kept pace with the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, others have criticized Harry and Meghan for dropping their bombshell while Harry's 99-year-old grandfather, Prince Philip, remains hospitalized in London after a heart procedure."

LYezPq-hSLyRM1-cyFgcLg	"Trump DOJ subpoenaed Twitter for identity behind Nunes parody account

The Trump administration subpoenaed Twitter for information on who was operating an account parodying Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a close ally of the former president, according to court documents unsealed on Monday.

A federal judge unsealed a motion from Twitter filed on March 10 to quash the subpoena that was issued in November. In the filing, Twitter argued it was concerned the government was aiding Nunes's legal efforts to attack and unmask his online critics and said the subpoena violated the First Amendment.

""It appears to Twitter that the Subpoena may be related to Congressman Devin Nunes's repeated efforts to unmask individuals behind parody accounts critical of him,"" the motion reads. ""His efforts to suppress critical speech are as well-publicized as they are unsuccessful.""

The subpoena sought identifying information from Twitter about the account @NunesAlt. There is little public information about the court proceedings around the subpoena. It's not clear whether Twitter ever complied with the demand or if it was ultimately quashed by a federal judge.

It's also unclear if the Biden administration's Justice Department stood by the subpoena after Trump left office. A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond when asked for comment on Monday.

According to the unsealed motion, the subpoena was issued along with a gag order prohibiting Twitter from revealing or talking about the document.

""Twitter is committed to protecting the freedom of expression for those who use our service,"" a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement Monday. ""We have a strong track record and take seriously the trust placed in us to work to protect the private information of the people on Twitter.""

Twitter declined to say whether it had complied with the subpoena.

A Nunes spokesman did not immediately respond when asked for comment on Monday.

Nunes has repeatedly tried to attack his critics in the courts, filing at least nine lawsuits in recent years against journalists, social media companies and political research firms.

In 2019, the California Republican sued Twitter, a political strategist and the parody accounts @DevinNunesMom and @DevinCow, accusing them of defamation. Last year, a judge removed Twitter from the suit, saying it could not be held liable for statements made by third parties on its platform.

lZoBiB6aSN6a8uE0HCxxPQ	"The Virginia Governor's Race Is a Republican Poll Watchers Test Run

The Virginia governor's race, a dead heat between Terry McAuliffe and Glenn Youngkin, is being regarded as a bellwether for the 2022 midterms, with Democrats trying to turn it into a referendum on former President Donald Trump and Republicans trying to turn it into a referendum on current President Joe Biden. But the contest may also be a different kind of preview of 2022 and 2024: The role poll watchers, seemingly inspired by Trump's election fraud lies, will play in upcoming cycles.

As the Washington Post reported Wednesday, a surge of GOP election observers are flooding the Virginia gubernatorial race, apparently driven by the party's push to ensure the system's ""integrity""—the euphemism allies of the former president have used to enact voter suppression laws and sow distrust in the democratic process. The 2020 election was not ""rigged,"" as Trump continues to claim, and even Youngkin, a MAGA Republican, has publicly acknowledged that Biden was legitimately elected. But Trump's incessant lies, including sketchy accusations of cheating in Virginia, have driven an influx of volunteers to turn out as a ""line of defense against election fraud.""

""You've all got to be out there,"" Clara Belle Wheeler, a former Virginia elections official, said at a conservative training event for prospective poll watchers recently, per the Post. ""You're the front line of defense.""

Poll watching is legal in most states and something both parties do. But the monitoring has been infused with greater drama in the 2020 cycle, as Trump and his allies spread conspiracy theories about a ""rigged"" process in which the election was stolen from him and Republican election observers were not given proper access in key states. None of that was true, but it has persisted into this off-year race as well: ""The Virginia governor's election—you better watch it,"" Trump said on a conservative radio program last month. ""You have a close race in Virginia, but it's not close if they cheat.""

That remark echoed his call during a presidential debate last year for his supporters to ""go into the polls and watch very carefully""—a line that was seen as an encouragement of voter intimidation. ""The president is blatantly urging his supporters to congregate at polling places, go inside, and ostensibly harass and intimidate voters,"" Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said at the time. ""While there are authorized 'poll watchers' who monitor polls on Election Day, their duties are clearly laid out, and they do not include what President Trump has suggested."""
me9xI-e2TemSGl3ZY_sqYQ	"Impeachment Managers Argue Trump Incited Capitol Siege, Audio and Video Evidence Presented

WASHINGTON – House impeachment managers on Wednesday argued that former President Donald Trump incited the violent siege on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, leading to five deaths. Through audio and video clips, they claimed that Trump did not act to stop the riot as the mob entered the Capitol, and that rioters claimed they went to the Capitol at Trump's invitation, believing they were acting on his instructions.

Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) stated, ""The attack on the Capitol was carried out for Trump and at his wishes. He egged them on, he encouraged them, and he did nothing to stop them.""

A timeline of Trump's actions on January 6 was presented, including tweets encouraging Republicans to fight and making baseless claims about voter fraud. Trump's tweets demanded that Vice President Mike Pence reject electoral votes and attacked Pence when he did not. At the ""Save America Rally,"" Trump told the crowd to march to the Capitol and ""fight like hell.""

As the Capitol was breached, Trump made a call attempting to pressure more objections to the election results. Despite the violence, Trump's initial responses included attacks on Pence and support for the rioters, only later asking for peace. Twitter banned Trump for 12 hours, and he was later permanently banned from the platform.

""The evidence is clear: Donald Trump incited a violent insurrection against the United States government,"" said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), one of the impeachment managers. ""He deliberately provoked and encouraged his followers to attack the very heart of our democracy.""

The impeachment managers presented audio and video clips of Trump's speech at the ""Save America Rally,"" in which he urged the crowd to ""fight like hell"" and march to the Capitol. They also played a recording of Trump's call to Pence, in which he pressure the vice president to reject the electoral votes.

""This was not a spontaneous event,"" said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). ""This was not a random act of violence. This was a deliberate and coordinated attack on the United States government, and Donald Trump is responsible.""

The impeachment managers argued that Trump's actions were not only illegal but also dangerous, as they undermined the rule of law and threatened the stability of the democratic system. They urged the Senate to convict and remove Trump from office, citing his clear and present danger to the country.

""Donald Trump is not above the law, and he is not above impeachment,"" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.). ""He must be held accountable for his actions, and he must be removed from office.""

The impeachment trial is expected to continue for several days, with both sides presenting their arguments and evidence. The Senate is expected to vote on whether to convict and remove Trump from office in the coming days."

Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady are reflecting on his past Super Bowl wins and losses, and the moments that surrounded them.

During episode five of the ESPN+ series Man in the Arena: Tom Brady, the model and her husband discuss Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, when the New York Giants defeated the New England Patriots.

Immediately after the game, Bündchen was caught on camera fiercely defending the quarterback in response to hecklers. The now-infamous comment, ""My husband cannot f---ing throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time,"" made headlines at the time as a perceived dig at his teammates.

During the game, Bündchen, 41, recounted the nerves she was feeling as Brady, 44, faced down Giants quarterback Eli Manning. ""I couldn't handle it was too much for me, it was a nail-biter,"" she recounted, adding, ""And I'm like drinking wine because I'm just trying to relax. it was the most stressful game ever, I think.""

After the game ended in the Patriots' loss, the mom of two said, ""So now we have to walk to the freaking elevator. And these guys who probably had a few drinks on them as well were like, 'Your husband sucks.' "" She continued recounting, "" 'Just tell him to go home and cry like a baby.' ""

It was then that Bündchen made the remark, which she told Brady about later that night in their hotel room.

""I said, 'You can't say that,' "" Brady explained in the Man in the Arena episode.

""I thought I was like mild, what I said. I mean it's true, how can he do everything? He can't catch and throw the ball at the same time, that's just a fact,"" Bündchen doubled down now.

Still, there were repercussions, like some people assuming her comment was directed at Brady's teammate Wes Welker. She said she was surprised to see some thought that was her implication, asserting now, ""that's the hardest working guy I know in that team.""

Welker, for his part, seemed to be a good sport about it. He said during the episode, ""I know where her heart is so I know who she is so I almost agreed with her at the time.""

Brady and Bündchen have hinted at her remark before. In fact, in 2019 Brady posted a humorously edited video of himself to Instagram in which he has a football toss — with himself.

nOL4F_u3Sz6Jfd3__h8q2g	"Tom Brady's Most Cherished NFL Moment: A Triumphant Return to Glory

Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback who has etched his name into the annals of football history, has experienced countless unforgettable moments during his illustrious 21-year NFL career. From hoisting the Lombardi Trophy seven times to setting numerous records, Brady's journey has been marked by extraordinary achievements. However, in a recent interview on the ""Let's Go!"" podcast co-hosted by Jim Gray, Brady revealed his most cherished NFL moment, a victory that holds a special place in his heart.

Brady's favorite NFL moment is the New England Patriots' thrilling 28-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX. This triumph marked a significant milestone in Brady's career, as it came after a four-year gap between his third and fourth Super Bowl wins. The victory was particularly poignant for Brady, who had endured the disappointment of losing two Super Bowls during that period.

""Winning that fourth Super Bowl was just such a special moment,"" Brady said on the podcast. ""It had been a long time since we had won one, and it was just such a hard-fought game. It was a great feeling to finally get back on top.""

The Super Bowl XLIX victory was a testament to the Patriots' resilience and determination. Trailing 24-14 in the fourth quarter, Brady led the team on a remarkable comeback, culminating in Malcolm Butler's famous last-minute interception that sealed the win.

While Brady was not on the field for the play he considers his favorite moment, he emphasized that his focus has always been on winning rather than personal stats. ""I'm not a stat guy,"" Brady said. ""I'm just trying to win games. That's what I've always been about.""

In recognition of Butler's pivotal role in the victory, Brady gifted him the MVP truck he received for his performance in Super Bowl XLIX. This gesture exemplified Brady's humility and appreciation for his teammates.

Throughout his illustrious career, Brady has amassed an astonishing 236 regular season wins, 34 postseason wins, and seven Super Bowls. Despite these numerous achievements, Brady cherishes the Patriots' win over the Seahawks above all.

""That was the moment that I'll remember for the rest of my life,"" Brady said. ""It was just such a special feeling to win that game with that team.""

Brady's favorite NFL moment is a testament to the power of perseverance, teamwork, and the pursuit of excellence. It is a moment that will forever be etched in the memories of Patriots fans and football enthusiasts alike.

OA6sGhHeR76UMBs83hAVPA	"More details about the October 4 outage

Now that our platforms are up and running as usual after yesterday's outage, I thought it would be worth sharing a little more detail on what happened and why — and most importantly, how we're learning from it.

This outage was triggered by the system that manages our global backbone network capacity. The backbone is the network Facebook has built to connect all our computing facilities together, which consists of tens of thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables crossing the globe and linking all our data centers.

Those data centers come in different forms. Some are massive buildings that house millions of machines that store data and run the heavy computational loads that keep our platforms running, and others are smaller facilities that connect our backbone network to the broader internet and the people using our platforms.

When you open one of our apps and load up your feed or messages, the app's request for data travels from your device to the nearest facility, which then communicates directly over our backbone network to a larger data center. That's where the information needed by your app gets retrieved and processed, and sent back over the network to your phone.

The data traffic between all these computing facilities is managed by routers, which figure out where to send all the incoming and outgoing data. And in the extensive day-to-day work of maintaining this infrastructure, our engineers often need to take part of the backbone offline for maintenance — perhaps repairing a fiber line, adding more capacity, or updating the software on the router itself.

This was the source of yesterday's outage. During one of these routine maintenance jobs, a command was issued with the intention to assess the availability of global backbone capacity, which unintentionally took down all the connections in our backbone network, effectively disconnecting Facebook data centers globally. Our systems are designed to audit commands like these to prevent mistakes like this, but a bug in that audit tool prevented it from properly stopping the command.

This change caused a complete disconnection of our server connections between our data centers and the internet. And that total loss of connection caused a second issue that made things worse.

One of the jobs performed by our smaller facilities is to respond to DNS queries. DNS is the address book of the internet, enabling the simple web names we type into browsers to be translated into specific server IP addresses. Those translation queries are answered by our authoritative name servers that occupy well known IP addresses themselves, which in turn are advertised to the rest of the internet via another protocol called the border gateway protocol (BGP).

To ensure reliable operation, our DNS servers disable those BGP advertisements if they themselves can not speak to our data centers, since this is an indication of an unhealthy network connection. In the recent outage the entire backbone was removed from operation, making these locations declare themselves unhealthy and withdraw those BGP"
OEqKyh3XTHeuAlsrSwWxkQ	"Legacy of SBK Records Echoes in Universal Music Group's $50 Billion Valuation

The recent valuation of Universal Music Group (UMG) at $50 billion, following its successful initial public offering (IPO), has stirred a wave of reminiscence and reflection in the music industry. Among those who have been closely watching the trajectory of the music giant is Marty Bandier, a retired music executive and co-founder of SBK Records, a pioneering label that made waves in the late '80s and early '90s.

UMG's IPO marks a significant milestone in the music industry, highlighting the enduring value and potential of recorded music. Bandier, with his decades-long experience in the field, expressed his thoughts on the impressive valuation, noting that it reflects the industry's resilience and growth.

""It's a great day for the music business,"" said Bandier. ""The fact that UMG is worth $50 billion shows the power of music and its enduring appeal.""

SBK Records, under the stewardship of Bandier, Stephen Swid, and Charles Koppelman, carved a unique niche in the music industry. Established in 1988, the label quickly gained recognition for breaking multi-platinum records and operating independently from the conventional practices of major labels at the time.

Koppelman, the founder of CAK Entertainment, recalled the genesis of SBK Records, which emerged from the acquisition of CBS Songs in 1986.

""We were fortunate to acquire CBS Songs, which was a great catalog of music,"" said Koppelman. ""That gave us the foundation to build SBK.""

The label's early success was characterized by its ability to identify and nurture promising talent, launching the careers of many future executives in the music industry, including Daniel Glass and Pete Ganbarg.

Glass, the President and Founder of Glassnote Records, credited SBK with providing him with invaluable experience early in his career.

""I learned so much from Marty and Charles,"" said Glass. ""They were great mentors and gave me the opportunity to work with some of the biggest names in the music business.""

Ganbarg, currently the President of A&R at Atlantic Records and President of ATCO, echoed Glass's sentiments, highlighting SBK's impact on his professional trajectory.

""SBK was an incredible incubator for talent,"" said Ganbarg. ""I was lucky to be part of it and I'm grateful for the opportunities I had there.""

SBK's meteoric rise caught the attention of Thorne-EMI, a British media conglomerate, which acquired the label in 1991. However, Koppelman and Bandier's time at SBK came to an end in the same year when they sold their half of the company back to Thorne-EMI for $26 million.

Reflecting on their decision, Koppelman stated, ""It was a difficult decision, but it was the right one at the time.""

Bandier added, ""We were proud of what we had accomplished with SBK and we felt that it was time to move on.""

Koppelman and Bandier's departure from SBK marked a turning point in their illustrious careers. They went on to assume major roles within EMI and later Sony, solidifying their influence on the music industry's landscape.

Koppelman's extensive experience encompasses a vast catalog of iconic artists and the acquisition of valuable music catalogs, amassing over 125 million records sold globally. Bandier, regarded as one of the most influential figures in music publishing, has guided the careers of countless legendary artists, including Madonna, Mariah Carey, and David Bowie.

The story of SBK Records serves as a testament to the ever-evolving nature of the music industry and the strategic moves of its leading figures. Valuations in the music industry"
owCPzJgLTp26wxIJ9uiKag	"A minute-by-minute timeline of Trump's day as the Capitol siege unfolded on Jan. 6

WASHINGTON – House impeachment managers on Thursday argued former President Donald Trump's actions not only fueled the violent assault on the Capitol in the months leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, but that he stood by as the riot raged and showed no remorse in aftermath, which left five people dead.

Through a series of audio and video clips from security footage – some of which were previously undisclosed – as well as rioters' social media accounts documenting the day, House impeachment managers prosecuting Trump argued that the former president failed to act as a mob forced their way inside the building and hunted for congressional leaders.

Rioters said at the time and later testified to authorities that they went to the Capitol at Trump's invitation.

""Their own statements before, during and after the attack make clear the attack was done for Donald Trump, at his instructions and to fulfill his wishes,"" Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said Thursday. ""Donald Trump had sent them there.""

Here's a look at what Trump was doing on the day the attack unfolded:

12:43 a.m.: Trump retweets a post suggesting that Republican legislators should ""go to the wall"" for the president, with the added comment: ""Get smart Republicans. FIGHT!""

1:00 a.m.: Trump tweets about Pence's ceremonial role in presiding over the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. He suggests Pence had the authority to reject electoral votes, which he did not.

""If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be.) Mike can send it back!""

8:06 a.m.: Trump lashes out at NBC's Chuck Todd in a tweet.

""Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd is so happy with the fake voter tabulation process that he can't even get the words out straight. Sad to watch!"" he tweets.

8:17 a.m.: Trump again posts a tweet demanding Pence reject the electoral vote count, which he has no authority to do.

""States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!""

8:22 a.m.: Trump tweets: ""THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR COUNTRY, NEEDS THE PRESIDENCY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE - THE POWER OF THE VETO. STAY STRONG!""

9:00 a.m.: Trump tweets baseless claims about voter fraud.

""They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!"" he tweets.

9:15 a.m.: Trump again tweets about voter fraud:

""The States want to redo their votes. They found out they voted on a FRAUD. Legislatures never approved. Let them do it. BE STRONG!""

9:16 a.m.: Trump tweets ""Even Mexico uses Voter I.D.""

10:44 a.m.: Trump tweets about former Sen. David Perdue, R-Georgia, who lost his seat in a runoff election the day before.

""These scoundrels are only toying with the @sendavidperdue (a great guy) vote. Just didn't want to announce quite yet. They've got as many ballots as are necessary. Rigged Election!"" he tweeted.

11:57 a.m.: Trump takes the stage to deliver remarks at the ""Save America Rally"" at the White House Ellipse as ""God Bless the U.S.A."" plays in the background.

12:15 p.m.: Trump tells the crowd to march to the Capitol and that ""you'll never take back our country with weakness."" During his remarks, hundreds of people begin moving toward the Capitol.

1:10 p.m.: After speaking for nearly an hour, Trump encourages supporters to ""fight like hell"" and march to the Capitol as rioters begin storming the Capitol steps around the same time.

""We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,"" Trump said. ""So we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue – I love Pennsylvania Avenue – and we are going to the Capitol.""

With Moderna and Pfizer ramping up production, Johnson & Johnson poised to earn emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and the White House promising 13.5 million vaccine doses per week to states, many see a light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel.

As of Wednesday, 14.5% of Coloradans had gotten at least one shot and 6.8% were fully vaccinated.

Learn more about vaccines On Tuesday, March 2, at the Campus Q&A, McQueen and Jennifer McDuffie, associate vice chancellor of Health and Wellness, will join other guests for a webinar on vaccine safety. Get Details on This & Other Upcoming Webinars Learn More About CU Boulder's Vaccine Rollout

""Through the use of vaccines, we have the ability to end this pandemic,"" said Matt McQueen, director of epidemiology for the Pandemic Response Office at CU Boulder.

But with increased vaccine availability have also come questions about how they work and what they do and don't do. CU Boulder Today caught up with McQueen, a professor of integrative physiology, to get some answers.

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. What does that mean and how are they different than traditional vaccines?

mRNA (short for ""messenger ribonucleic acid"") vaccines are just a different way to deliver the instructions to our immune system to recognize this virus and mount a response. Traditional vaccines use a virus that has been attenuated, or weakened, so they don't cause infection but trigger your body to develop antibodies toward it. Other vaccines, like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, deliver a part of the SARS-CoV2 virus on an existing and harmless virus, called a vector.

mRNA vaccines, instead of sending the virus or bits of virus, just send the blueprint for part of the virus—the spike protein. The blueprint gets inside your cells, which then manufacture the spike protein, and when the body detects it, your body generates an immune response. The mRNA has a short lifetime inside your cells and does not, as rumored, make any change to your DNA. Instead, your cells make the spike protein just long enough for your immune system to learn what the virus will look like if you are ever exposed and be ready to fight it off.

Are these new mRNA vaccines safe?

Yes. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were approved for emergency use by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). As part of the approval process, independent experts reviewed the data from approximately 33,000 individuals who received either vaccine and concluded that side effects were relatively mild and short-lived and the known and potential benefits of avoiding serious disease from coronavirus outweighed the risk. Since these vaccines have been approved, roughly 63 million doses have been administered and the vaccines continue to be monitored for safety.

Will I have side effects after getting the shots?

Some people do. Others don't. Anecdotally, there seems to be a higher incidence of side effects of the second dose among younger people. That's to be expected because a younger, more robust immune system will ramp up more of a response than an older immune system. Common symptoms include pain at the injection site, general fatigue and tiredness, headache and fever. It's a normal reaction—just your immune system doing its job.

Matt McQueen

peD-RDGRT-SbgOknvA81Kw	"A president hasn't refused to attend the inauguration of his successor in 152 years. Donald Trump will change that

WASHINGTON — By skipping President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, President Donald Trump will break from White House tradition, but won't make history, when he misses the ceremonial peaceful transfer of power.

Trump will become the first outgoing president to refuse to attend the inauguration of his successor since 1869 when President Andrew Johnson stayed in the White House as Ulysses S. Grant was sworn in as the 18th president.

Presidents John Adams in 1801 and John Quincy Adams in 1829 also chose not to attend the inaugurations of the presidents who replaced them, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, respectively. Both left Washington before the ceremonies.

""It's crucial for the peaceful transfer of power. It's about respect,"" said presidential historian Kate Andersen Brower. She pointed to the nation's last two one-term presidents, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, who both attended inaugurations after losing elections. Brower said they took their losses ""very personally, but there's always an understanding that the country is more important than your ego. That's obviously not the case here.""

Trump confirmed he won't attend the Jan. 20 inauguration of Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in a Tweet Friday. It was no surprise after Trump spent the weeks since his Nov. 3 election loss leveling false claims of voter fraud to try to overturn the election.

""One of the few things he and I've ever agreed on – him not showing up,"" Biden told reporters. Conversely, he said he would welcome Vice President Mike Pence's attendance and would be ""honored to have him there.""

1869: The Johnson-Grant feud

Like Trump, Johnson's decision came less than a year after he was impeached by the House. Johnson, a Democrat from Tennessee, and Grant, a Republican former Civil War general, despised each other. Grant supported Johnson's impeachment.

While Grant was sworn into office in front of the Capitol, Johnson met with Cabinet members and signed bills, according to the Washington Post, following a last-minute decision not to attend.

For his part, Grant refused to ride in the same carriage as Johnson from the White House to the Capitol. The plan was for them to ride in separate carriages. But when Grant showed up at the White House 30 minutes before the ceremony, Johnson did not come out.

""At noon, (Johnson) stood up and shook hands with his Cabinet members,"" the Post's historical account says. ""As he headed out the door for the last time, he said, 'I fancy I can already smell the sweet mountain air of Tennessee.' ""

Trump's move comes despite ""ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition"" and calling for ""healing and reconciliation"" just one day earlier as he finally conceded the election. Trump faces the possibility of a second impeachment led by Democrats in response to pro-Trump rioters who stormed the Capitol as Congress counted electoral votes Wednesday confirming Biden's victory.

""I think this tweet today is not at all surprising if you've been paying attention to the way Trump speaks and behaves,"" said Brower, author of author of ""Team of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump.""

CNN — For nearly six hours on Monday, the world experienced a forced break from Facebook's social networking tools.

We lived to tell the tale. But how did we feel in the process?

Although relatively short, the Facebook outage showed ""how reliant we are on social media in different ways to distract ourselves, to escape, to connect, to cope with anxiety and stress,"" according to Ian Kerner, a marriage and family therapist.

When people can't scroll and post as they usually do, Kerner said they can become bored and vulnerable to difficult emotions and stressors – sometimes without knowing how to cope with them.

""People find that they are alone with their own thoughts. And they're a little bit of a stranger to themselves in a way. Prior to social media, I think we were much better at being on our own, finding ways to engage ourselves and remain curious,"" Kerner added.

A sense of relief

The collective nature of the outage had some of Kerner's clients feeling liberated, he said.

""People definitely have a fear of missing out,"" Kerner explained. Losing or breaking a phone, or having a phone die can cause folks to panic, he said, as it prevents them from knowing what's happening and being connected to others.

The outage, conversely, ""provided a great sense of relief, because everybody was experiencing it. So people didn't feel as alone or as isolated or as panicked,"" Kerner told CNN.

Therapist John Duffy reported having similar conversations with his clients on Monday.

""Once people realized, 'oh, these networks are almost all down,' there was this bizarre, but very clear sense of relief. The feeling was 'I don't have anything I have to keep up with. I'm not missing out on anything,'"" Duffy told CNN.

During the outage, ""people realized in real time the importance of face-to-face relationships, and the relative emptiness of a connection that takes place solely via Facebook or Instagram,"" he added.

Clients that expressed relief during the outage took concrete steps to connect with others in real life, Duffy said. ""One took a friend out for coffee. Another took a walk with a friend,"" he said.

The teenager who pulled out her cellphone and began recording when she saw George Floyd being pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer was given a special citation by the Pulitzer Prizes on Friday for her video that helped to launch a global movement to protest racial injustice.

Darnella Frazier was cited ""for courageously recording the murder of George Floyd, a video that spurred protests against police brutality, around the world, highlighting the crucial role of citizens in journalists' quest for truth and justice,"" the Pulitzer Prizes said.

Frazier was not giving interviews to the media, her publicist said Friday.

Frazier was 17 when she recorded the arrest of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, on May 25, 2020.

At the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin earlier this year, Frazier testified that she was walking to a corner grocery store to get snacks with her then-9-year-old cousin when she saw a man being pinned to the pavement, ""terrified, scared, begging for his life.""

She said she didn't want her cousin to see what was happening so she ushered the girl into the store then went back out to the sidewalk and began recording because ""it wasn't right. He was suffering. He was in pain.""

Frazier kept recording even though she said she felt threatened when Chauvin ignored the cries of bystanders and pulled out his Mace as he knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds.

Her video, which shows Floyd repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe before going limp, was posted to Facebook hours after it was recorded, sparking outrage in Minneapolis and beyond. It was also a prominent piece of evidence in Chauvin's trial.

Chauvin was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. He will be sentenced June 25.

The Pulitzer Board also announced Friday that the Star Tribune of Minneapolis won the breaking news reporting prize for its coverage of Floyd's murder and its aftermath.

Roy Peter Clark, a senior scholar at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, said in a column for Nieman Lab last month that Frazier should win a Pulitzer for her video.

Clark, who has been a Pulitzer juror five times, told The Associated Press on Friday that Frazier was like the many journalists or artists who have won Pulitzer Prizes for standing up for tolerance, equality and social justice.

""There she was, at 17, sort of witnessing an injustice and she stood there in the face of threats and captured that video,"" he said. ""It would be hard to select, even from the work of professional journalists over recent years or decades, a 10-minute video that had as profound an impact as this young woman's video did.""

Frazier's video was ""globe shaking,"" spoke truth to power and gave a voice to the voiceless, Clark said."

REEJmERWShWKB0E2ve3hUw	"Lady Gaga Recalls Wearing Dove Brooch at Joe Biden's Inauguration and Says Dress Was 'Bulletproof'

Lady Gaga is opening up about the outfit she chose when she sang the national anthem at President Joe Biden's inauguration in January.

The 12-time Grammy Award winner, 35, claimed that the Schiaparelli Haute Couture look she wore for the occasion was ""bulletproof"" as she looked back on her fashion evolution in a video shared Monday by British Vogue.

""This is one of my favorite things I've ever worn,"" Gaga said. ""I wore this Schiaparelli design for the inauguration, and nobody knows this, but this is a bulletproof dress.""

She wore a custom look by Schiaparelli creative director Daniel Roseberry, featuring a structured navy fitted jacket with a red silk ballgown skirt. It is not clear how the dress was made bulletproof or whether the singer was wearing a bulletproof vest under the ensemble.

Gaga fondly recalled the look's gold dove brooch, featuring an olive branch in its beak, which she wore as a symbol of peace. ""When I saw that golden dove, I just knew that this was the right piece,"" she raved about the accessory.

""And I knew, Schiaparelli being an Italian fashion house, it was something that I really, really wanted to do for my heritage as an Italian-American woman that would be singing for President 45 to be leaving and to invite President 46 into office,"" Gaga added.

The Chromatica artist also reminisced about Marine Capt. Evan Campbell, who escorted her to the microphone. ""And I'll never forget speaking to this young man that I was with,"" she said. ""He was asking me if I was nervous and I said yes. But sometimes, fashion can really give you wings... like a dove.""

Gaga previously opened up to PEOPLE about the once-in-a-lifetime experience in January. ""It was the honor of my lifetime,"" she said after her performance.

""I wish to send an extended prayer out to all the people that live on this land, that you will feel whole, that you will feel loved, that we all work in the interest of building the beloved community together,"" Gaga added."

Jonathan Riehl is a former political reporter and speechwriter. He used to own the only known existing Volvo 164E in color #109, ""Ocean Green."" Much has already been written on the life and times of former secretary of state Colin L. Powell, who died Monday. As a high-schooler in Northern Virginia, I looked up to him as the kind of leader I was raised to respect, a beacon of honor and patriotism. But he had something in common with my family and me that had nothing to do with politics: We were all aficionados of old Volvos. I drove my dad's 1964 cherry-red 544 in our homecoming parade.

The mechanic who worked on that car when my dad couldn't also serviced Powell's 1967 lime green 122, which he decided to put up for sale just as I got my license in 1993. This was at Don Beyer's dealership in Falls Church.

I wanted to buy that Volvo (on Powell's right in the photo above), so over a series of phone calls, Powell and I talked cars and a little bit of politics and agreed on a price for what would be my first car. The mechanic who set those calls up, who is now 85, recently told me he remembers it as clear as day and that Powell was very concerned that his car would go to good home. Evidently, I made the cut.

Eventually, though, Powell decided he just couldn't let it go; it was a part of who he was, there was too much of him in it. Of course, I was disappointed.

rUx2RZCMTN-IxeJ58DmFHA	"QAnon Supporters Claim Gabby Petito Case Is a 'False Flag' to Distract from Biden's Failures

In a shocking turn of events, QAnon supporters have managed to twist the tragic story of Gabby Petito into a bizarre conspiracy theory. According to these conspiracy theorists, Gabby Petito's disappearance and subsequent murder are nothing more than a carefully orchestrated 'false flag' operation designed to divert attention from President Biden's alleged failures.

These QAnon believers have gone as far as to suggest that Gabby Petito was a 'crisis actor' enlisted by the 'deep state' to manipulate public perception for their own agenda. They claim that her case is just another in a long line of fabricated events meant to shift focus away from what they believe are the real issues plaguing society.

On various QAnon forums and Telegram channels, discussions are rife with theories about Gabby Petito's homicide being staged. Some even go as far as to suggest that Gabby Petito herself was an actress, casting doubt on the very existence of her fiancé, Brian Laundrie.

The concept of 'false flags' is a recurring theme in QAnon ideology, with believers asserting that such events are part of a larger deep-state agenda to distract the public from more significant matters. It's a tactic that has been used time and time again, according to these conspiracy theorists.

On platforms like 8Kun, a forum that has become a central gathering point for QAnon followers after migrating from 4chan and 8Chan, users are busy speculating on the symbolism behind the names 'Gabby Petito' and 'Brian Laundrie'. They believe there is a deeper meaning to these names that ties into their elaborate conspiracy theories.

QAnon has a troubling history of labeling victims of tragedies as hoaxes, with past targets including George Floyd and victims of the Parkland school shooting. The movement has consistently shown a willingness to dismiss real suffering and pain as nothing more than staged events meant to manipulate the masses.

Even U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vocal supporter of QAnon theories, has been known to lend credence to claims that tragic events are actually staged. Her influence only serves to perpetuate these harmful and baseless beliefs among her supporters.

Despite the absurdity of these claims, the Gabby Petito case has captured the world's attention, with millions following the search for her missing fiancé, Brian Laundrie. It is a tragic situation that has been overshadowed by outlandish conspiracy theories, threatening to strip away the humanity of a young woman who lost her life in the most horrifying circumstances.

In a remarkable demonstration of environmental responsibility, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been recognized by Population Matters, a UK-based charity that focuses on sustainable human population growth. The couple was acknowledged for their ""enlightened"" decision to limit the size of their family to two children, signifying their commitment to reducing their environmental impact.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose children Archie and Lilibet 'Lili' Diana were born in May 2019 and June 2021, respectively, have impressed environmental advocates with their conscientious decision-making.

A spokesperson from Population Matters praised the couple's decision, highlighting the significant environmental benefits of smaller families. They told reporters:

""By choosing to have a smaller family, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are helping to take pressure off the Earth's resources. This is a responsible decision at both the personal and global level.""

Indeed, Prince Harry has previously been vocal about his concerns regarding climate change and the strain of human activities on the environment. In a 2019 Vogue interview, the Duke emphasized the importance of safeguarding the world for future generations, even discussing the impact of children on the environment:

""What we need to remind everybody is: these are our children that we are bringing into the world. The greatest inheritance that we can give to our children, and those responsible for us, is to leave them in a better place.""

He further explored these concerns in his 2021 Apple TV+ documentary 'The Me You Can't See,' where he opened up about addressing mental health issues and the impending climate crisis:

""The fact that we are now having conversations about the mental health of our children before they're even born is staggering.""

In total, Population Matters recognized ten recipients for their vital contributions to promoting sustainability, coinciding with the UN's World Population Day. Additional awardees included Emma Gannon, Nairashe Maritsa, and Wendo Aszed, all of whom have demonstrated leadership in discussions on family size and empowerment.

Each award recipient, Harry and Meghan included, will receive a £500 contribution to donate to a charity of their choice, reiterating Population Matters' ongoing commitment to sustainable development and environmental responsibility. This recognition sends a powerful message to people worldwide about the importance of addressing the environmental crisis and the role each individual can play in protecting the planet for future generations."
Tqa8rA_URLuSnZEJl-bzUA	"Trump impeached after Capitol riot in historic second charge

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was impeached by the U.S. House for a historic second time Wednesday, charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly mob siege of the Capitol in a swift and stunning collapse of his final days in office.

With the Capitol secured by armed National Guard troops inside and out, the House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump. The proceedings moved at lightning speed, with lawmakers voting just one week after violent pro-Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol, egged on by the president's calls for them to ""fight like hell"" against the election results.

Ten Republicans fled Trump, joining Democrats who said he needed to be held accountable and warned ominously of a ""clear and present danger"" if Congress should leave him unchecked before Democrat Joe Biden's inauguration Jan. 20.

Trump is the only U.S. president to be twice impeached. It was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in modern times, more so than against Bill Clinton in 1998.

The Capitol insurrection stunned and angered lawmakers, who were sent scrambling for safety as the mob descended, and it revealed the fragility of the nation's history of peaceful transfers of power. The riot also forced a reckoning among some Republicans, who have stood by Trump throughout his presidency and largely allowed him to spread false attacks against the integrity of the 2020 election.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked Abraham Lincoln and the Bible, imploring lawmakers to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign ""and domestic.""

She said of Trump: ""He must go, he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.""

Holed up at the White House, watching the proceedings on TV, Trump later released a video statement in which he made no mention at all of the impeachment but appealed to his supporters to refrain from any further violence or disruption of Biden's inauguration.

""Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week,"" he said, his first condemnation of the attack. He appealed for unity ""to move forward"" and said, ""Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. ... No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement.""

Trump was first impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, but the Senate voted in 2020 acquit. He is the first president to be impeached twice. None has been convicted by the Senate, but Republicans said Wednesday that could change in the rapidly shifting political environment as officeholders, donors, big business and others peel away from the defeated president.

Biden said in a statement after the vote that it was his hope the Senate leadership ""will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation."""

uQa6rRWbQfSQ5pQ1KgkmGg	"Smit Salvage assists with Ever Given refloating effort in Suez Canal

Dutch salvor Smit Salvage has been enlisted to help refloat the grounded containership that has blocked the Suez Canal since Tuesday.

Martijn Schuttevaer, spokesman for Dutch marine services company and Smit parent company Boskalis, told Reuters late on Wednesday that it had dispatched a 10-strong team to assist with the operation.

Shipping agencies that handle canal transits reported the salvage operation that saw dredgers and tugs dispatched to the 20,388-teu Ever Given (built 2018) were suspended overnight but are set to resume on Thursday morning.

Earlier reports on Wednesday that the grounded vessel has been partially refloated and had been moored alongside the canal bank proved premature.

On Thursday morning the ship remained wedged across the southern section of the canal with tugs belonging to the Suez Canal Authority and Svitzer still in attendance.

Norwegian canal transit specialist Leth Agencies reported via Twitter late on Wednesday night that the plan for Thursday included moving the two vessels that were immediately behind the Ever Given out of the canal and back to the Suez anchorage to make room for tugs to refloat the stranded ship and tow it back to Suez.

Article continues below the advert

These ships, the 6,200-teu containership Maersk Denver (built 2007) and 63,000-dwt bulker Asia Ruby III (built 2014), were moored alongside the canal bank after the Ever Given blocked their path.

Insurance nightmare

The Shoei Kisen-owned Ever Given has protection and indemnity coverage from the UK P&I Club, while its hull and machinery is insured in the Japanese market, insurance sources told Reuters on Wednesday.

The claims total in the millions of dollars even if the ship is refloated quickly as Shoei Kisen and its insurers could face claims from the Suez Canal Authority for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage has been disrupted, they said.

There could also be claims for damage to the canal itself.

The UK P&I Club will be required to cover all third-party risks for damage caused to cargo during transit, risks of environmental damage and injuries.

So far, there have been no reports of pollution, injuries, or damage to the Ever Given's cargo.

The cost of the salvage operation is borne by the hull and machinery insurer.

The bulk of those insurance claims would then likely be reinsured through a programme run by the wider International Group of P&I Clubs, said David Smith, head of marine at insurance broker McGill and Partners.

Backlog grows

With an average of 50 or so vessels transiting the Suez Canal every day, its closure following Tuesday's grounding has led to a large and growing backlog of ships.

The result has been a temporary standstill the busiest Asia to Europe trade route.

Leth Agencies reported on Thursday morning that 71 vessels were at Suez Anchorage awaiting a northbound transit.

A further 79 vessels were awaiting a southbound transit, of which 34 were anchored at Great Bitter Lake and 45 at Port Said's outer anchorage.

This volume of shipping continued to grow steadily as more vessels arrived at the anchorages.

Depending on when the canal can open, some analyst predict it might take up to a week for the backlog to clear.

TradeWinds reported on Wednesday that analysts expected the disruption to boost freight rates and create security risks.

Industry experts forecasted that the spectacle would provide a short-term boost to container rates, while tanker and bulker owners could also benefit.

Figures from Kepler Cheuvreux revealed 27% of the global container trade utilised the Suez Canal last year.

""Given the already stretched supply situation for the container fleet, this closure of the canal is likely to have an upward effect on container freight rates, already close to all-time-high levels,"" the financial services provider said.

Greg Knowler, senior European editor at JOC by IHS Markit, said that the blockage came at ""a particularly unhelpful time"" with the Asia-Europe supply chain stretched to the limit."

Armed with a fresh round of stimulus checks, Americans may be ready to shop...for some bitcoin and stocks.

A new survey out of Mizuho Securities on Monday estimates that 10%, or nearly $40 billion of the $380 billion in direct stimulus checks, may be used to purchase bitcoin and stocks. Mizuho managing director Dan Dolev and his team surveyed approximately 235 individuals with less than $150,000 of household income. Of that, about 200 said they expect to receive the third round of direct stimulus payments in the coming days.

Nearly 2-in-5 check recipients expect to use some portion of their checks to invest. And stimulus check recipients prefer bitcoin over stocks, according to the survey.

""The survey predicts that bitcoin will account for 60% of total incremental investment spend. We calculate it could add as much as 2-3% to bitcoin's current $1.1t trillion market value,"" Dolev writes.

Dolev says stocks from his coverage universe that should benefit the most from people buying equities with their checks include Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Square.

Mizuho isn't alone in its call on the use of stimulus checks.

A good chunk of the new stimulus money about to be funneled into American households shortly via the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill may find its way into the stock market, Goldman Sachs says.

""We expect households will be the largest source of equity demand this year,"" Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote recently. ""We raise our household net equity demand forecast to $350 billion from $100 billion, which reflects faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021.

The latest round of stimulus checks will be sizable, hence Wall Streeters optimism some of the funds will find their way into asset classes such as bitcoin and stocks."
us0R_d6zRzauTyQCst0Ffg	"Prosecutors push to rearrest Kyle Rittenhouse. Here's how the case has unfolded since he posted bail

(CNN) -- Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager accused of fatally shooting two men and wounding a third during the Jacob Blake protests in August, is under further scrutiny by authorities that could lead to his return to jail.

Wisconsin prosecutors Wednesday asked to issue an arrest warrant for Rittenhouse, stating he violated his bail agreement by not disclosing his address after his release. Rittenhouse's legal team has countered with the need to keep his location secret due to claims of death threats against him.

Much attention has been directed at Rittenhouse's case proceedings, particularly as a cause célèbre among right-wing circles. His supporters welcomed the news on November 20 that he left jail after an apparent fundraising effort met the $2 million required.

Now, where he awaits trial is in question.

How the case has developed

Rittenhouse faces allegations in Kenosha, Wisconsin, relating to the shooting deaths of Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz. Rittenhouse's attorneys have maintained that he acted in self-defense.

Rittenhouse left the scene shortly after the August 25 shootings and returned home to Antioch, Illinois, where he was arrested the following day.

On October 30, he was extradited from Illinois to Wisconsin. The following week, his bond was set at $2 million due to the court considering him a ""flight risk,"" according to Kenosha County Commissioner Loren Keating.

Rittenhouse was released November 20 after the $2 million bail was posted by Lin Wood, chairman and CEO of #FightBack, according to the Kenosha County Sheriff's Department.

Wood said in a tweet that Mike Lindell, CEO of My Pillow, Inc., and others helped raise the funds needed for Rittenhouse.

""God bless ALL who donated to help #FightBack raise required $2M cash bail. Special thanks to Actor Ricky Schroder @rickyshroder1 & Mike Lindell @realMikeLindell for putting us over the top. Kyle is SAFE. Thanks to ALL who helped this boy,"" read the tweet.

On December 3, Rittenhouse attended a preliminary hearing remotely via video conference with Mark Richards, his attorney. Richards accused prosecutors during the hearing of presenting ""a one-sided, stilted view"" of events that night. The court determined that Rittenhouse would stand trial.

At a January 5 arraignment, Rittenhouse pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of homicide and a felony count of attempted homicide, among other charges. He attended virtually via Zoom.

State requests for further restrictions

Less than two hours after his arraignment, Rittenhouse, now 18, was seen at a Wisconsin bar with his mother, an outing confirmed by surveillance video, according to prosecutors.

In a motion filed to modify the terms of Rittenhouse's bond conditions, prosecutors said Rittenhouse was seen with other people flashing ""the 'OK' sign, which has been co-opted as a sign of 'white power' by known white supremacist groups,"" and was ""directly served a beer by the bartender.""

In Wisconsin, it is legal for someone under 21 to possess and consume alcohol if a parent is present. Rittenhouse cannot legally consume alcohol in public in his home state, Illinois."
UyCsxceOSgSCn2OS6HrWjA	"The Evergreen ship blocking the Suez Canal is not linked to Hillary Clinton

There is no evidence that an Evergreen ship stuck in the Suez Canal is linked to a human trafficking operation run by Hillary Clinton. That claim has been pushed by supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.

What do the Suez Canal, Hillary Clinton and a Taiwanese shipping company have in common?

Conspiracy theorists on Facebook insist they're all part of an international human trafficking scheme.

Egyptian authorities are working to remove a 1,300-foot cargo ship that got stuck March 23 in the Suez Canal, a critical shipping route that connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The boat is operated by the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan shipping conglomerate.

Some Facebook users took that as a signal of Clinton's involvement.

""HRC = Hillary Rodham Clinton. Evergreen = Hillary's Secret Service name. Evergreen Call Sign: H3RC,"" a March 24 post about the shipping accident says.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Similar false claims about Clinton, ""evergreen"" and human trafficking surfaced after the Beirut port explosion in August. The newest example is similarly bogus and traces back to a baseless conspiracy theory that's been circulating since 2016.

First, let's review some facts about Evergreen.

Evergreen Line is the trade name for the five shipping companies owned by the Evergreen Group. The companies comprise the fourth largest container fleet in the world, according to the JOC Group, a logistics intelligence firm.

An Evergreen ship got stuck in a bank of the Suez Canal during a dust storm with high winds, the Wall Street Journal reported. The incident involves an Ever Given ship, which is one of the largest ocean vessels in the world. More than 100 ships are waiting to traverse the canal, dealing a blow to global shipping.

The story turns into fiction with the added elements of Clinton and human trafficking. The conspiracy theory goes like this: Clinton is part of a global child sex trafficking cabal, and her Secret Service codename was ""Evergreen."" (She confirmed the codename during the 2016 campaign.) Therefore, Clinton is using Evergreen to transport children.

That baseless line is related to the broader Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracy theories about prominent Democrats and child victims.

After the Ever Given ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, QAnon supporters on Telegram and Gab, social media platforms that are popular among conservatives, pointed to the boat's call sign, H3RC, as evidence to support their theory. Clinton's initials are HRC."

A concerned bystander called 911 to report a domestic dispute after witnessing Laundrie strike Petito. According to the caller, ""the gentleman was slapping the girl."" Another witness said it appeared Laundrie had taken her phone and locked her out of the van. He told police that he saw Petito hitting Laundrie as she fought to get back inside the van — her home at the time.

But when police pulled over the couple in the now-infamous white van to investigate further, they came to a very different conclusion about what had transpired. After separating and talking with both parties — one of whom was hyperventilating, and one of whom was calm and jovial — they made the determination that it was Petito who was the abuser and Laundrie the victim. Laundrie got a fist-bump from a police officer and was told he did nothing wrong before being driven to a hotel for a free night's stay. Petito was left with the van and made to spend a night alone in an unfamiliar place while experiencing an apparent mental-health crisis.

The hour-plus body-camera footage of the incident, released by the Moab City Police Department, offers some insight into why the officers came to the determination they did and provides a striking"

A peaceful winter morning in Plains Township, Pennsylvania, turned into a scene of unspeakable horror when a neighbor dispute over snow shoveling escalated into a deadly shooting. James Goy, 50, and his wife Lisa Goy, 48, were brutally killed by their neighbor Jeffrey Spaide, 47, who then took his own life as police closed in.

The altercation began when Spaide, an engineer and US Navy veteran, asked the Goys to stop shoveling snow onto his property. The situation quickly escalated from verbal to physical, with the Goys hurling insults at Spaide before he retaliated with gunfire.

Surveillance footage captured the tragic events that unfolded on that fateful day. The video shows the Goys shoveling snow onto Spaide's property, with Spaide approaching them and engaging in a heated argument. The situation quickly spirals out of control, with Spaide pulling out a handgun and firing at the couple.

As the Goys attempt to flee, Spaide retrieves an AR-style rifle from his home and continues to fire at them. The couple succumbs to their injuries, leaving their 15-year-old autistic son orphaned.

Spaide, described in an online obituary as a ""loving son, brother, and uncle,"" took his own life inside his home before police could apprehend him. Prosecutors revealed that Spaide was seen pacing back and forth before committing suicide as police arrived.

The incident has left the community in shock and grief, with neighbors struggling to come to terms with the senseless violence that occurred. ""It's just unbelievable. I can't even imagine what was going through his mind,"" said one neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous.

The authorities revealed that there had been a previous altercation between the neighbors, but no police record of incidents between them. The conflict began when Spaide asked the Goys to stop shoveling snow onto his property, which led to a heated argument.

The Goys, who were described by friends and family as a loving and kind couple, were devoted to their son and were actively involved in their community. Their tragic death has left a gaping hole in the lives of those who knew and loved them.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of escalating conflicts and the importance of seeking help before situations spiral out of control. As the community comes to terms with this senseless tragedy, they are left to wonder what could have been done to prevent it.

In the aftermath of this tragic event, the focus is now on supporting the Goys' 15-year-old son, who is struggling to cope with the loss of his parents. A local fundraising campaign has been set up to help cover funeral expenses and provide support for the teenager's future.

As the community rallies together to support the Goys' family, the memory of James and Lisa Goy will live on as a reminder of the importance of kindness, compassion, and the need to resolve conflicts peacefully."

Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, despite nursing a thumb injury, orchestrated a masterful performance on Sunday, guiding his team to a hard-fought 28-22 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. The six-time Super Bowl champion threw for two touchdowns and helped secure the Bucs' fifth win of the season, improving their record to 5-1.

Brady, who completed an impressive 34 of 42 passes for 297 yards, connected with Antonio Brown and O.J. Howard for the scoring passes. Brown, in particular, showcased his chemistry with the veteran QB, while Howard made the most of his opportunities. Leonard Fournette was another key contributor, rushing for two touchdowns and accumulating 81 rushing yards along with 46 receiving yards.

The Eagles, led by second-year quarterback Jalen Hurts, put up a valiant effort. Hurts displayed his dual-threat abilities, scoring two rushing touchdowns and throwing for another. However, his efforts were not enough to overcome the Bucs' dominant performance, as Philadelphia's record fell to 2-4.

Tampa Bay's offensive prowess was on full display, with the team amassing 399 total yards compared to the Eagles' 213. The Bucs controlled possession late in the game, effectively halting Philadelphia's comeback attempt. Despite Brady's impressive streak of 227 passes without an interception coming to an end at the hands of Eagles safety Anthony Harris, the future Hall of Famer showcased his resilience and poise under pressure.

Defensively, both teams had their moments, with the Buccaneers managing to limit Hurts' effectiveness through the air. Philadelphia's defense, on the other hand, struggled to contain Brady and the Tampa Bay offensive attack, especially in the red zone.

This victory for the Buccaneers serves as a statement win, solidifying their position as one of the top teams in the NFC. Meanwhile, the Eagles will look"

WJ-K2PSWSQSCHRisuoLIjw	"North Korea Showcases ""World's Most Powerful"" Weapons in Military Parade Amidst Heightened Tensions

PYONGYANG – North Korea staged a military parade on Thursday to celebrate the first congress of the country's ruling Workers' Party in nearly five years, showcasing what it claims to be ""the world's most powerful"" weapons, including a submarine-launched ballistic missile. The display of force comes as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watched the parade but refrained from making a speech, highlighting the regime's nuclear capabilities in the presence of top military officials and dignitaries.

Defense Minister Kim Jong Gwan declared on the occasion, ""Our republic has power to preemptively use power to smash hostile forces if they pose threat and challenge to us with ever-lasting tension."" The statement underscores the country's readiness to defend itself amidst intensifying regional and global security concerns.

The parade, attended by thousands of troops without face masks, aligns with North Korea's claims of being COVID-19-free. This notable absence of protective measures has raised concerns about the true extent of the virus in the country.

During the eight-day party congress, Kim Jong Un labelled the U.S. as Pyongyang's ""foremost principal enemy"" and vowed to expand the nation's nuclear arsenal. These statements offer insight into the increasingly frosty relationship between the two nations.

However, Kim did suggest that a strong defense posture does not hinder diplomacy. He hinted at the continuation of talks should the U.S. abandon its hostile policy toward the reclusive state. Following Kim's re-election as general secretary of the Workers' Party, diplomatic avenues might remain open despite the escalating tensions.

At the parade, Kim Jong Un emphasized, ""We have reached the threshold of a powerful strategic force with our own technology."" He further called for ""combat readiness"" to defend the nation from threats.

North Korea faces significant economic challenges, including a considerable drop in trade with China due to stringent COVID-19 measures and natural disasters that have affected agriculture. According to South Korea's central bank, the North Korean economy has shrunk by 4.5% in 2020, the largest contraction in 23 years.

Kim Jong Un acknowledged some economic hardships during the party congress, citing the need for ""self-reliance."" He urged the nation to rise above the issues and ""demonstrate the mettle of heroic Korea once again.""

Despite these hardships, the country remains defiant in its stance against perceived threats, as seen in the military parade and Kim's remarks.

Kim Jong Un's ardent focus on nuclear development reflects an effort to bolster his regime's power and security amidst rising regional and global pressures. Whether Kim's pledge to solidify the country's nuclear standing serves as a shield against perceived threats or a barrier to communication and conflict resolution remains to be seen.

In conclusion, North Korea's military parade and aggressive posturing serve as a show of force as the world anticipates the change in U.S. leadership. Diplomatic methods might yet prove essential in alleviating tensions and addressing North Korea's concerns.

Quote from Kim Jong Gwan, North Korean Defense Minister:

""Our republic has power to preemptively use power to smash hostile forces if they pose threat and challenge to us with ever-lasting tension."""

WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris said America is not a ""racist country"" but the nation must ""speak the truth"" about its history with racism on ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday.

The vice president's comments were in response to Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who gave the Republican Party's rebuttal to President Joe Biden's speech to Congress on Wednesday.

Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, spoke about his own experience with racism in the U.S. The senator contended ""America is not a racist country"" and said progressives perpetuate discrimination akin to Jim Crow-era policies.

'Your president has your back': President Biden addresses transgender Americans

""A hundred years ago, kids in classrooms were taught the color of their skin was their most important characteristic. And if they looked a certain way, they were inferior. Today, kids again are being taught that the color of their skin defines them, and if they look a certain way, they're an oppressor,"" Scott said in his speech

""It's backward to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination,"" the senator continued.

Harris, the country's first Black and first Indian American vice president, disagreed with some – but not all – of Scott's statements.

""Well, first of all, no, I don't think America is a racist country, but we also do have to speak the truth about the history of racism in our country and its existence today,"" Harris said while praising Biden's comments on race and domestic terrorism in his first joint address to Congress on Wednesday.

She applauded Biden for ""having the ability and the courage to speak the truth"" about the country's history with racism.

""He spoke what we know from the intelligence community: One of the greatest threats to our national security is domestic terrorism manifested by white supremacists,"" Harris said, referencing reports from federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies identifying white supremacists as a persistent and rising terror threat."

Our experts choose the best products and services to help make smart decisions with your money (here's how). In some cases, we receive a commission from our partners; however, our opinions are our own. Terms apply to offers listed on this page.

Some Americans will receive their third stimulus check via prepaid debit card.

It can be used to withdraw cash from an ATM, transfer funds to a bank account, issue a check, or make purchases wherever Visa is accepted.

Only one card will be provided per family, and the US government will not be able to see how the money is used.

The Treasury Department and IRS are once again sending some stimulus payments in the form of prepaid debit cards.

Most people who qualify for a third stimulus check will get their money via direct deposit to their bank account.

People who receive debit cards or paper checks are those who didn't provide bank information on their 2019 or 2020 tax returns in order to get a refund or didn't register through the IRS nonfilers tool by November 21.

Federal benefits recipients, including Social Security and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries, will get paid the same way they normally receive benefits.

A stimulus check is a non-taxable cash payment sent to qualifying Americans by direct deposit, check, or debit card. The money can be used however you want and does not need to be repaid to the government — even if you get too much. Other names for stimulus checks include Economic Impact Payments and the Recovery Rebate Credit.

What is the stimulus check debit card?

Formally called EIP (Economic Impact Payment) Cards, the debit cards are an alternative to receiving a paper check.

About 4 million Americans received debit cards loaded with their first-round stimulus payment in 2020. About 8 million new debit cards were issued for second-round payments. The IRS hasn't announced how many will go out in the third round, but if you got a card in the past it won't be reloaded with your new payment and you may not get a card at all this time.

The debit cards will be sent from Money Network Cardholder Services and arrive in a white envelope with the US Department of the Treasury seal. Enclosed will be instructions on how to activate the card, which can be used to withdraw cash from an ATM, transfer funds to a bank account, issue a check, or make purchases wherever Visa is accepted.

Only one card will be provided per family — for instance, a couple who files taxes jointly and is getting an additional payment for a dependent will get only one debit card.

Recipients of the prepaid card will be able to register the card for online access and visit EIPCard.com to check their balance and transaction history. The US government will not have access to a cardholder's transaction history.

Who gets a stimulus check?

You must have filed a 2019 or 2020 tax return, submitted information to the nonfilers tool by November 21, 2020, or currently collect federal benefits to receive the third stimulus check automatically. You also need to have a Social Security number.

Single filers and head-of-household filers will receive up to $1,400 each, and married joint filers will receive up to $2,800, plus $1,400 for each dependent."
Xmfl_TfiTlyu7-RroDLBOg	"McConnell Blocks Quick Senate Impeachment Trial for Trump, Leaves Door Open for Conviction

WASHINGTON (AP) – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has moved to block a quick Senate impeachment trial for President Donald Trump but has not ruled out the possibility of voting to convict the president. The House of Representatives voted 232-197 on Wednesday to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection, making him the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice.

McConnell has suggested that Trump's Senate trial will likely not commence until January 19, just one day before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. The Senate Majority Leader argues that a fair and thorough trial cannot be completed before Biden takes office, emphasizing the need to focus on ensuring a safe transition of power and inauguration.

While McConnell has not definitively decided on his vote, he plans to carefully listen to the legal arguments presented during the Senate trial. McConnell's stance on Trump appears to have cooled in recent days, potentially influencing other Republican lawmakers to distance themselves from the outgoing president.

In an unexpected move, McConnell has acknowledged that he believes Trump did commit impeachable offenses. This shift in perspective indicates that McConnell views the impeachment process as an opportunity for the GOP to separate itself from Trump and his actions, signaling a potential rupture within the party.

Despite calls for an emergency session to expedite the impeachment trial, the Senate remains in recess as McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have not reached an agreement on scheduling. It remains uncertain how many Republican senators would vote to convict Trump, with some GOP lawmakers expressing openness to considering the impeachment charges.

In light of potential threats of further violence by armed Trump supporters, Capitol security measures have been significantly increased in preparation for the Senate trial and the upcoming presidential inauguration. The heightened security precautions come after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, which a growing number of lawmakers and intelligence officials believe was incited by Trump.

As the nation awaits the Senate trial to determine Trump's fate, the political landscape in Washington remains tense and uncertain, with the looming specter of both the impeachment process and the transition to a new administration shaping the final days of Trump's presidency."
Xpe3JlyVTmyZiHGvMUdSbA	"Long Island woman, 22, disappears during cross-country trip with boyfriend

A 22-year-old Long Island woman has gone missing under mysterious circumstances during a cross-country road trip with her boyfriend — and her family is seeking the public's help in finding her.

Gabby Petito was last known to be in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park in late August after embarking on the tour with her boyfriend — identified on social media as Brian Laundrie — the month before, Newsday reported.

Authorities said the vehicle the couple was traveling in, a white 2012 Ford Transit van with Florida plates, has been recovered, according to the outlet.

Laundrie, who has returned to his Florida home, has hired an attorney and has refused to cooperate with authorities, the Daily Mail reported, citing her family.

""Downsizing our life to fit into this itty bitty van was the best decision we've ever made,"" Laundrie wrote on Instagram on a page called ""bizarre_design."" ""With the limited space we wanted to take advantage of every inch, while also keeping everything minimalist.""

On July 10, Petito wrote: ""After going on our first road trip across the country in my tiny car, we felt like there was just so much we missed. Turning this Ford transit essentially into a camper was such an adventure in itself, but I couldn't love the way it turned out more!

""All the places it's brought us so far have been amazing! As soon as we got to the Great Sand Dunes I didn't want to leave, there was so much to hike!"" Petito added.

Petito's mother, Blue Point resident Nicole Schmidt, reported her missing to Suffolk County police late Saturday.

""Gabrielle Petito was traveling in a white, 2012 Ford Transit van with Florida license plate QFTG03 with a companion when she stopped communicating with friends and family,"" police said in a release.

The desperate mom told Newsday late Sunday that her daughter had FaceTimed her around Aug. 23 or 24 — and that although she received texts from her daughter's phone until Aug. 30, she wasn't sure she was the one who had sent them.

Petito's father, Joe Petito, told Newsday that her disappearance is like ""drowning with your hands tied behind you,"" adding, ""You can't describe it. There's nothing you can do. You can't control anything.""

Joe moved from Long Island to Vero Beach, Florida, in June in part to be closer to his daughter, who had moved to the city of North Port in western Florida with her boyfriend about two years ago.

On June 17, Petito arrived in New York to attend her brother's high school graduation and then left on her cross-country adventure, Schmidt said.

Last month, the couple arrived in Salt Lake City, Utah, but left amid heavy wildfire smoke, according to Fox News.

Petito was expected to visit a family friend in Portland, Oregon, around Halloween, Newsday said.

XzblBYv6Sd6ULTayNdDAfQ	"Massive Container Ship Blocks Suez Canal, Disrupting Global Trade and raising Security Concerns

In a surprising turn of events, a colossal container ship named Ever Given, registered in Panama and measuring an impressive 400m in length and 59m in width, became wedged sideways across Egypt's Suez Canal on Tuesday, March 23, 2021, causing a significant disruption to global shipping and commerce.

Admiral Osama Rabie, Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, reported that more than 100 ships were prevented from passing through the canal by Thursday morning. Rabie expressed his concerns, stating, ""We are taking all necessary measures to refloat the ship as soon as possible."" He further added that at least eight tug boats were involved in the rescue efforts (BBC News, 2021).

The Suez Canal is a vital artery for global trade, especially for oil transportation. Its blockage raises concerns for ships in the Red Sea possibly becoming attack targets. Salvatore R. Mercogliano, Associate Professor of History at Campbell University, weighed in on the gravity of the situation, remarking, ""The Ever Given incident underscores the importance of the Suez Canal as a chokepoint in global commerce. Any extended closure would have far-reaching economic and geopolitical consequences"" (The Conversation, 2021).

Egypt has reopened an older channel of the canal to alleviate some of the traffic until the Ever Given can be moved. However, the blockage could severely impact global shipping, potentially hampering the delivery of food, fuel, and goods between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.

The Suez Canal is a key link for global trade and a major income source for Egypt, having undergone a major expansion in 2015. The incident comes at a time when the Egyptian economy is already grappling with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The cause of the ship becoming wedged remains unclear, with conflicting reports about a sandstorm and a blackout. However, strong winds were mentioned as a factor. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which manages the Ever Given, confirmed all 20 crew members were safe with no injuries or pollution reported.

Admiral Rabie stated, ""We are working closely with the ship's owner and the salvage team to refloat the vessel as soon as possible. We appreciate the understanding of the maritime community and will provide further updates as soon as we have more information"" (Suez Canal Authority, 2021).

The Ever Given incident is not the first time the Suez Canal has been blocked. In 2009, a container ship named the Ever Given's predecessor, also with the same name, ran aground in the canal, causing a six-day closure.

The Suez Canal has been a target for militants in the past. In 2014, a suicide bombing targeted a security checkpoint near the canal, killing two policemen. In 2015, a bomb exploded on a cargo ship in the canal, causing minor damage but no injuries.

Given the strategic importance of the Suez Canal and the potential consequences of an extended closure, global attention remains focused on the ongoing efforts to refloat the Ever Given.

CNN Business – In a digital age where connectivity is key, a nefarious side effect has emerged: a sharp rise in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure and physical business operations. According to Check Point Software, ransomware attacks have surged by an alarming 102% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period last year. This escalation has prompted the US Department of Justice to establish a ransomware task force in April, signaling the growing concern over these extortion-related cyber threats.

Amid this cyber onslaught, experts are sounding the alarm, emphasizing the need for a united front between government and the private sector to curtail the wave of digital extortion. ""Without cooperation and significant investment from both parties, ransomware attacks are likely to persist and even accelerate,"" asserts Katell Thielemann, Vice President Analyst at Gartner for security and risk management.

One of the significant challenges in battling this issue comes from the operational model of the attackers themselves. Cybercriminal groups like REvil and DarkSide, predominantly based in Russia, have been identified as key perpetrators, operating under a 'ransomware-as-a-service' model. This business model complicates the efforts to counteract their operations and increases the necessity for robust cybersecurity practices.

The rise in cyber threats has caught the attention of the US government, urging both public and private sectors to bolster their cyber defenses. Jen Psaki, White House Press Secretary, highlighted this urgency in a recent briefing, stating, ""Improving our cybersecurity practices is paramount. The administration is committed to partnership with the private sector to tackle this issue head-on.""

The pandemic has, unfortunately, played a role in exacerbating the situation. The sudden shift to remote work has peeled back layers of cybersecurity, laying bare significant vulnerabilities. ""Remote work has revealed just how gaping our cyber defenses really are,"" said Eric Cole, a former cybersecurity commissioner to the Obama administration and author.

Indeed, the connectivity of critical infrastructure to the internet has opened a Pandora's box of possibilities for cybercriminals. Mark Ostrowski, Head of Engineering at Check Point, noted, ""The increasing internet connection of critical infrastructure is a double-edged sword. While it can improve efficiency, it also makes these essential services more susceptible to attacks.""

The pandemic has not only revealed vulnerabilities but has also seen attackers specifically targeting healthcare facilities and other vital"

Facebook has shut down the accounts of several Ugandan government officials ahead of the country's presidential and parliamentary elections, citing ""Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour"" as the reason for the removal. The move has sparked controversy, with senior press secretary to President Museveni, Don Wanyama, accusing Facebook of attempting to influence the election.

According to Kezia Anim-Addo, Head of Communication, Facebook Sub-Saharan Africa, the social media giant removed a network of accounts and pages linked to Uganda's ministry of information and communications technology. The network was accused of seeking to manipulate public debate and sway voter opinion.

""We have removed a network of accounts and pages linked to the Ugandan government for violating our policies against coordinated inauthentic behavior,"" Anim-Addo said in a statement. ""We are committed to protecting the integrity of elections and will not tolerate any attempts to manipulate public debate.""

The removed accounts included both Facebook and Instagram accounts of officials and ruling party supporters. Among those affected was Don Wanyama, who accused Facebook of targeting the ruling party and President Museveni's supporters.

""Facebook has removed my account and many others, claiming that we were involved in coordinated inauthentic behavior,"" Wanyama said. ""This is a clear attempt to influence the election and support the opposition.""

President Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, is facing a strong challenge from Bobi Wine, a popular musician-turned-politician. Museveni has accused foreign elements of backing his opponent, and the removal of the government officials' accounts has heightened tensions ahead of the election.

Facebook's action is part of a broader effort to combat manipulation and disinformation on its platform. Since 2017, the social media giant has removed over 100 networks worldwide for similar reasons.

However, the move has sparked criticism, with some accusing Facebook of censorship and interfering in the election. Others have praised the move, saying it is necessary to protect the integrity of the election.

Social media platforms are facing increased scrutiny for their content management, especially after recent actions against former US President Donald Trump. Facebook's decision to remove the Ugandan government officials' accounts has added fuel to the debate, with some calling for greater transparency and accountability.

Despite the controversy, Facebook remains committed to protecting the integrity of elections and ensuring that its platform is not used to manipulate public debate.

""We take our responsibility to protect the integrity of elections seriously,"" Anim-Addo said. ""We will continue to monitor our platform and take action against any attempts to manipulate public debate.""

As Uganda prepares to go to the polls, the role of social media in the election is under the spotlight. Facebook's decision to remove the government officials' accounts has set a precedent, and it remains to be seen how the platform will be used in the coming days and"

Dutch salvor Smit Salvage has been enlisted to help refloat the grounded containership that has blocked the Suez Canal since Tuesday.

Martijn Schuttevaer, spokesman for Dutch marine services company and Smit parent company Boskalis, told Reuters late on Wednesday that it had dispatched a 10-strong team to assist with the operation.

Shipping agencies that handle canal transits reported the salvage operation that saw dredgers and tugs dispatched to the 20,388-teu Ever Given (built 2018) were suspended overnight but are set to resume on Thursday morning.

Earlier reports on Wednesday that the grounded vessel has been partially refloated and had been moored alongside the canal bank proved premature.

On Thursday morning the ship remained wedged across the southern section of the canal with tugs belonging to the Suez Canal Authority and Svitzer still in attendance.

Norwegian canal transit specialist Leth Agencies reported via Twitter late on Wednesday night that the plan for Thursday included moving the two vessels that were immediately behind the Ever Given out of the canal and back to the Suez anchorage to make room for tugs to refloat the stranded ship and tow it back to Suez.

Article continues below the advert

These ships, the 6,200-teu containership Maersk Denver (built 2007) and 63,000-dwt bulker Asia Ruby III (built 2014), were moored alongside the canal bank after the Ever Given blocked their path.

Insurance nightmare

The Shoei Kisen-owned Ever Given has protection and indemnity coverage from the UK P&I Club, while its hull and machinery is insured in the Japanese market, insurance sources told Reuters on Wednesday.

The claims total in the millions of dollars even if the ship is refloated quickly as Shoei Kisen and its insurers could face claims from the Suez Canal Authority for loss of revenue and from other ships whose passage has been disrupted, they said.

There could also be claims for damage to the canal itself.

The UK P&I Club will be required to cover all third-party risks for damage caused to cargo during transit, risks of environmental damage and injuries.

So far, there have been no reports of pollution, injuries, or damage to the Ever Given's cargo.

The cost of the salvage operation is borne by the hull and machinery insurer.

The bulk of those insurance claims would then likely be reinsured through a programme run by the wider International Group of P&I Clubs, said David Smith, head of marine at insurance broker McGill and Partners.

Backlog grows

With an average of 50 or so vessels transiting the Suez Canal every day, its closure following Tuesday's grounding has led to a large and growing backlog of ships.

The result has been a temporary standstill the busiest Asia to Europe trade route.

Leth Agencies reported on Thursday morning that 71 vessels were at Suez Anchorage awaiting a northbound transit.

A further 79 vessels were awaiting a southbound transit, of which 34 were anchored at Great Bitter Lake and 45 at Port Said's outer anchorage.

This volume of shipping continued to grow steadily as more vessels arrived at the anchorages.

Depending on when the canal can open, some analyst predict it might take up to a week for the backlog to clear.

TradeWinds reported on Wednesday that analysts expected the disruption to boost freight rates and create security risks.

Industry experts forecasted that the spectacle would provide a short-term boost to container rates, while tanker and bulker owners could also benefit.

Figures from Kepler Cheuvreux revealed 27% of the global container trade utilised the Suez Canal last year.

""Given the already stretched supply situation for the container fleet, this closure of the canal is likely to have an upward effect on container freight rates, already close to all-time-high levels,"" the financial services provider said.

Greg Knowler, senior European editor at JOC by IHS Markit, said that the blockage came at ""a particularly unhelpful time"" with the Asia-Europe supply chain stretched to the limit."

(NYSE: PFE) today announced its investigational novel COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate,PAXLOVIDTM, significantly reduced hospitalization and death, based on an interim analysis of the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis showed an 89% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint); 0.8% of patients who received PAXLOVIDTM were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (3/389 hospitalized with no deaths), compared to 7.0% of patients who received placebo and were hospitalized or died (27/385 hospitalized with 7 subsequent deaths). The statistical significance of these results was high (p<0.0001). Similar reductions in COVID-19-related hospitalization or death were observed in patients treated within five days of symptom onset; 1.0% of patients who received PAXLOVIDTM were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (6/607 hospitalized, with no deaths), compared to 6.7% of patients who received a placebo (41/612 hospitalized with 10 subsequent deaths), with high statistical significance (p<0.0001). In the overall study population through Day 28, no deaths were reported in patients who received PAXLOVIDTM as compared to 10 (1.6%) deaths in patients who received placebo.

At the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pfizer will cease further enrollment into the study due to the overwhelming efficacy demonstrated in these results and plans to submit the data as part of its ongoing rolling submission to the"

In a bombshell series of reports, The Wall Street Journal has obtained internal Facebook documents that paint a damning picture of the social media giant's awareness of and inaction on several key issues. The ""Facebook Files"" series reveals that Facebook has been aware of the negative impacts of its platform, including the spread of misinformation and harmful content, but has failed to take adequate measures to address these problems.

One of the most significant revelations is the existence of the XCheck program, which exempted high-profile users from Facebook's rules and allowed them to post content that would have otherwise been flagged as misinformation or harmful. According to the documents, less than 10% of flagged posts under the XCheck program were reviewed, raising serious questions about the effectiveness of Facebook's content moderation policies.

In addition to the XCheck program, the documents also reveal that internal Facebook research found that Instagram harms teens' mental health, particularly among girls, leading to body image issues and depression. However, Facebook downplayed its own research and did not make the findings public, raising concerns about the company's responsibility to protect the well-being of its young users.

Despite these concerns, Facebook continues to develop an Instagram platform for children, despite backlash and calls for the project to be abandoned. The documents also reveal that a 2018 Facebook algorithm change intended to improve user interaction actually amplified divisive and harmful content, leading to increased polarization and conflict on the platform.

In response to the revelations, a Facebook spokesman, Andy Stone, told The Wall Street Journal, ""We take these issues very seriously and are working to improve our platforms and protect the well-being of our users."" However, the company's claims of taking action have been met with skepticism, given the lack of concrete steps taken to address the problems identified in the documents.

Lars Backstrom, Vice President of Engineering at Facebook, defended the company's use of the XCheck program, saying, ""The purpose of the XCheck program is to prevent the spread of misinformation and harmful content, and it has been effective in doing so."" However, critics argue that the program creates a double standard, where high-profile users are given preferential treatment and are allowed to post content that would be flagged and removed from the platform.

In conclusion, the ""Facebook Files"" series reveals a disturbing pattern of awareness and inaction on the part of Facebook, raising serious questions about the company's responsibility to protect its users and promote a safe and secure online environment. As the world's largest social media platform, Facebook has a moral obligation to take the necessary steps to address these problems and ensure the well-being of its users."

CNN is trying to stay out of anchor Chris Cuomo's latest family affair.

CNN said it had no plans to discipline its top primetime anchor, despite the fact that he provided counsel during staff meetings to his brother, Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, while he was in the midst of fending off sexual harassment accusations.

A report Thursday in The Washington Post revealed that Cuomo, who anchors CNN's 9 p.m. hour and has been its most-watched anchor for months, took part in sessions earlier this year with Gov. Cuomo, his communications team, attorneys and other advisors. The younger Cuomo, the anchor, raised eyebrows in 2020 when he conducted several interviews with the older Cuomo, the governor, on his CNN program during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Conducting interviews with prominent family members is typically seen as a breach of professional ethics for journalists.

""Chris has not been involved in CNN's extensive coverage of the allegations against Governor Cuomo — on air or behind the scenes. In part because, as he has said on his show, he could never be objective. But also because he often serves as a sounding board for his brother,"" CNN said in a statement. ""However, it was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor's staff, which Chris acknowledges. He will not participate in such conversations going forward.""

A spokesperson said no punishment was being contemplated for the anchor.

Rival news outlets have suspended top anchors or taken them off the air for violations of protocol. Fox News Channel in 2019 removed Jeanine Pirro's popular Saturday program for a period of time in the wake of remarks she made about Minnesota Democrat Ihan Omar, a U.S. representative. The Fox Corp.-owned network never provided a public rationale for doing so. MSNBC suspended both Joe Scarborough and Keith Olbermann in 2010 after they made donations to political candidates – a clear violation of NBC News policies.

Some prominent news organizations have taken pains to separate employees from coverage of relatives who gain traction in the public sphere. At CBS News, former division president David Rhodes kept himself away from editorial decisions that had to do with coverage of his brother, Ben Rhodes, a national security adviser during the Obama administration. In 2019, James Bennet, the former editorial page editor of The New York Times, recused himself from any of his department's coverage of the run up to the 2020 presidential election after his brother, a Colorado Senator, announced his candidacy.

Cuomo, a veteran of ABC News, has gained traction since coming to CNN in 2013. His pugnacious on-screen demeanor has become a signature element of CNN under current chief Jeff Zucker, He has given anchors more leeway"
zzIiJmIjR4SoLfgSDvqZnQ	"Fact-check: Would Trump lose post-presidency benefits if impeached?

Facebook posts: Say that a second impeachment means Donald Trump loses his lifetime pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and his ability to run for public office.

PolitiFact's ruling: Mostly False

Here's why: House Democrats have filed an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for ""willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States"" after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 that temporarily stopped Congress from counting electoral college ballots.

With only nine days until Inauguration Day, the Democrats' move to impeach Trump is unlikely to result in his removal from office. But a viral social media post says it could have lasting effects on his future in public life.

The post, published by the liberal Facebook page The Other 98% on Jan. 9, outlined four potential consequences for Trump if the House votes to impeach him for a second time:

""For those wondering if it's worth impeaching him this time, it means he:

Loses his 200k+ pension for the rest of his life

Loses his 1 million dollar/year travel allowance

Loses lifetime full Secret Service detail

Loses his ability to run in 2024.""

Celebrities like comedian Jim Gaffigan and advocacy organizations like the March for Science have shared the post to millions of followers.

The source of the screenshot in the posts is a Jan. 8 tweet from Ben Costiloe, a 57-year-old man who lives in Texas. He told PolitiFact that he copied the text from something he saw on Facebook.

""I looked at"
