1023	"Millions of Seniors Begin Receiving Third Stimulus Checks

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has started distributing the third round of Economic Impact Payments (EIPs), also known as stimulus checks, to millions of senior citizens who didn't file a 2019 or 2020 tax return. The IRS commenced processing payments for around 30 million seniors after receiving crucial data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in late March.

Payments are primarily being disbursed in the same manner recipients usually receive their regular Social Security benefits, mostly through electronic means. Those receiving Social Security retirement benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits who didn't submit a 2019 or 2020 tax return are included in this group. Veterans receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs and who didn't file a recent tax return will also obtain their payments shortly.

Fortunately, for the majority of beneficiaries, there's no need to take any action to obtain their stimulus payment. The IRS will automatically send the payments to eligible recipients through direct deposit, Direct Express debit card, or by paper check, depending on how they usually receive their benefits.

However, some beneficiaries might need to file a 2020 tax return to claim additional funds for a spouse or dependents, especially if they didn't file a joint tax return with their spouse in 2019 or if they've acquired new dependents since their last filed tax return.

Most eligible Americans will receive a base amount of $1,400, with married couples getting $2,800 and an additional $1,400 for each dependent. To determine eligibility, the IRS will rely on the adjusted gross income (AGI) from the most recent tax return available. Third stimulus checks will be phased out for individuals with higher AGIs. For single filers, the phaseout begins at $75,000, with payments reduced by 5% of the amount by which the filer's AGI exceeds the threshold. The phaseout is complete at an AGI of $80,000, above which no payment will be distributed.

Although the original deadline for filing a 2020 tax return was April 15, 2021, the IRS has extended it to May 17, 2021, to accommodate those still working on their tax returns and to facilitate the distribution of stimulus checks. This extension is particularly beneficial for those who didn't file a 2019 or 2020 tax return and are still eligible for a stimulus payment, as it provides them with additional time to submit their returns and claim any additional funds.

In summary, millions of seniors have started receiving their much-needed third stimulus checks, thanks to the IRS's collaboration with the SSA. Veterans receiving benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs will also receive their payments shortly. Most eligible beneficiaries do not need to take any action to receive their payments, but some may need to file a 2020 tax return to claim additional funds for a spouse or dependents. The IRS is working diligently to distribute these payments promptly and efficiently, providing a vital financial boost to millions of Americans during these challenging times."
165	"A History of Tension: Six Justices Absent from Biden's Swearing-In, Highlighting Past Confrontations

President Joe Biden's swearing-in ceremony on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday was marked by a notable absence: six Supreme Court justices, including three liberal and three conservative members, chose to skip the event due to public health concerns amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

According to Kathleen Arberg, a spokeswoman for the Supreme Court, Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito Jr. did not attend. This marks the first absence of Supreme Court justices at a presidential inauguration in over 20 years.

Arberg stated, ""The Justices typically attend the inauguration of the President, but the decision to attend is made by each Justice individually. This year, due to the ongoing public health crisis and in keeping with current CDC guidance, some Justices have decided not to travel to Washington, D.C. for the inauguration.""

The Supreme Court has been operating remotely since March 2020, with only one in-person gathering for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's memorial service in September.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the presidential oath to Biden, despite the two having opposed Roberts' confirmation in the past. In 1993, then-Senator Biden, a Democrat, voted against Roberts' confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, Biden strongly opposed Roberts' nomination to the Supreme Court, stating, ""I don't think he's a consensus figure.""

Justice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Kamala Harris, marking a series of firsts for both officials. Sotomayor is the third woman and the first Latina Supreme Court justice, while Harris is the first woman, the first Black person, and the first South Asian American to be elected vice president.

Biden and Harris have historically voted against the confirmation of six out of the nine current Supreme Court justices. In addition to Roberts, they opposed Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.

Biden's attempts to filibuster Alito's nomination in 2006 and his role in Thomas's contentious confirmation hearing in 1991 reflect a history of tension. During Thomas's confirmation hearing, Biden chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and led the questioning of Anita Hill, who had accused Thomas of sexual harassment.

Thomas has publicly criticized Biden's conduct during the hearings. In his 2007 autobiography, ""My Grandfather's Son,"" Thomas wrote, ""I have often wondered whether Senators Biden and Montoya [D-N.M.] really believed the allegations against me or whether they knew that the allegations were false but used them for political gain.""

Despite past confrontations, Biden reached out to Hill to express regret for her treatment during the hearings. In a statement, Biden said, ""To Anita Hill: I could not have been more wrong then, I was a senator and a jury member. I owe you an apology.""

The absence of some justices at the inauguration hints at enduring political and personal tensions. Thomas's decision not to attend, in particular, could be seen as a symbolic gesture in light of his long-standing feud with Biden. However, it is essential to note that the justices' decisions not to attend were based on health concerns amid the pandemic."
331	"Hundreds of Thousands of Livestock Trapped and Starving in Suez Canal Disaster.

The EU is scrambling to address the unfolding animal welfare disaster in the Suez Canal, where approximately 200,000 live animals are stranded behind the 'Ever Given' cargo vessel and facing likely death due to being stuck without food and water.

Gabrile Păun, the EU director for Animals International, has called this the worst maritime animal welfare tragedy in history.

The animals, which originate from Romania, are running out of both feed and water.

EU law mandates that ships carrying live animals must have 25% more food than planned, but this rule is often not followed.

Romanian authority ANSVSA claims that there is enough food and water for a few days, but live animal exports have been suspended."

1226	"WHO Validates Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use, Addressing Global Access Inequity

The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, marking a significant milestone in the global efforts to combat the pandemic. This validation assures that the vaccine meets international standards for safety, efficacy, and manufacturing, and paves the way for its distribution and use in countries around the world.

According to Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products, the validation of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is a crucial step towards addressing global access inequity. ""We need multiple COVID-19 vaccines to ensure that all countries have access to safe and effective vaccines, particularly low- and middle-income countries that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic,"" she said.

The WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for the COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement, and the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is the first vaccine to receive this validation. The WHO assessment of the vaccine included on-site inspections of its production facility, and the vaccine was found to be suitable for low-resource settings due to its easy storage requirements.

The WHO recommends the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine for adults 18 years and older, with a two-dose schedule. Vaccine efficacy results showed that it prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of recipients and severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population. While efficacy in older adults (over 60 years) could not be estimated from trials, the WHO does not recommend an upper age limit due to supportive data.

Dr Simão emphasized that the EUL process assesses novel health products during public health emergencies, focusing on safety, efficacy, and quality. ""The validation of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is a testament to the WHO's commitment to ensuring that all countries have access to safe and effective vaccines, and we will continue to work towards this goal,"" she said.

In conclusion, the WHO's validation of the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use is a significant step towards addressing global access inequity and ensuring that all countries have access to safe and effective vaccines. The WHO will continue to work towards this goal, and we are confident that the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine will play a crucial role in the global efforts to combat the pandemic."
636	"Egypt could ask for up to $1 billion in compensation for Ever Given crisis

CAIRO — Egyptian authorities may seek over $1 billion in damages for helping to clear the Ever Given from the Suez Canal, as a dilemma emerges over who might foot the bill. ""We will reach over a billion dollars in compensation,"" Osama Rabie, the chairman and managing director of the state-owned Suez Canal Authority, told Egypt's Sada El Balad channel on Wednesday evening. Rabie said the figure is based on canal revenue losses, the cost of equipment and machinery, and the manpower hours for the 800 rescuers who freed the ship. ""We will ask for a fair amount,"" Rabie said, according to a NBC News translation, without specifying who might be liable to pay. ""We saved them so much by rescuing the ship without any major damage or losses,"" he added. ""The whole ship could've been lost."" The 200,000 ton mega-container carrier was successfully refloated on Monday, six days after coming stuck sideways in the Suez Canal. The incident sparked a crisis in international shipping, held up $9 billion in global trade a day and left 422 vessels carrying everything from crude oil to cattle waiting to pass. Authorities said the backlog would be cleared by Saturday, but the maritime traffic jam could have long lasting repercussions on ports and supply chains worldwide. Rabie said he hoped a compensation agreement could be reached ""in two or three days"" and if not, Egypt might hold the ship in the Great Bitter Lake, north of the Suez Canal, where it is currently undergoing maintenance checks. ""We could agree on a certain compensation, or it goes to court,"" he said. ""If they decide to go to court, then the ship should be held,"" he warned."
1825	"Pence calls VP-elect Kamala Harris to offer congratulations

WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Mike Pence has called his soon-to-be successor Kamala Harris to offer his congratulations, according to two people familiar with the conversation.

It's the first known contact between the elected members of the outgoing and incoming administrations. President Donald Trump has not reached out to President-elect Joe Biden or invited him to the White House, and has instead spent the weeks since he lost the Nov. 3 election holed up at the White House, trying to undermine the legitimacy of Biden's win with baseless claims of mass voter fraud that culminated in last week's violent storming of the Capitol building.

Pence, who didn't speak with Trump for days after the siege, has become an unexpected — albeit late — defender of Biden's win. The vice president resisted enormous pressure from Trump to try to interfere in Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote count last week — even though he has no such power. And he has announced that he will attend Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration, which Trump is refusing to do — making him just the fourth president in the nation's history to skip the symbolic passing of the torch.

Pence and Harris spoke Thursday afternoon and had a ""good call,"" according to one of the people familiar with the conversation, with Pence congratulating Harris and offering his assistance. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private exchange.

The call came less than a week before Biden and Harris take office and just over a week after Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol and tried to halt the peaceful transition of power after he delivered a speech calling on them to ""fight."" Five people died, including a Capitol Police officer, and Trump got impeached on a charge of incitement of an insurrection.

While Trump has remained largely behind closed doors, without his Twitter bullhorn and fuming since his loss, Pence has been stepping up and fulfilling many of the ceremonial duties of the presidency.

On Thursday, Pence received a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington from the FBI and other agencies on inauguration security and stopped by to thank White House phone operators, giving them a framed letter of appreciation. Later, he greeted members of the National Guard now protecting the Capitol building from further attack.

This weekend, he will travel to thank the troops — first flying to Lemoore, California, to deliver remarks to sailors, and then to Fort Drum, New York, to speak before 10th Mountain Division soldiers, many of whom recently returned from Afghanistan."
1910	"Britain tells Taliban: Militants must never attack West from Afghanistan

LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Britain cautioned the Taliban on Tuesday that Afghanistan must never be used to launch terror attacks but added that the West must try to positively influence the insurgents who have grabbed power after the United States withdrew its forces.

Britain fears the Taliban's return and the vacuum left by the West's chaotic withdrawal will allow militants from al Qaeda and Islamic State to gain a foothold in Afghanistan, just 20 years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the West would have to be pragmatic in its relations with the Taliban, try to see if it could moderate the new rulers of Afghanistan and even try to convince them to be ""inclusive"".

""Our message is going to be this: Afghanistan must never be used to launch terrorist attacks against the West, we've had 20 years of success in that regard,"" Raab told Sky.

""We want to do everything we can, through the full range of diplomatic-economic sanction measures, to make sure we can use as much leverage as we conceivably have, and I'm realistic about that, to try and moderate and exercise some form of positive influence around the regime,"" he said.

Told by a Sky reporter that the Taliban were a ""red tag bunch of thugs"", Raab said: ""I'm not going to dissent from that view but they are now in power, and we now need to deal with that reality.""

""We want to test whether there is scope to moderate the kind of regime that we will now see in place,"" Raab said.

Raab said the position at Kabul airport was stabilising.

""The position at the airport is stabilising,"" he said. ""The stability at the airport is absolutely key.""

Asked by the BBC if he could see himself sitting down with the Taliban, Raab said: ""No, not for the foreseeable future, but we've always had dialogue of some sort.""

Meanwhile, Britain's Prince Harry, who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan and founded the Invictus Games sporting event for wounded former military personnel, encouraged veterans from the conflict to offer support for each other.

""What's happening in Afghanistan resonates across the international Invictus community,"" Queen Elizabeth's 36-year-old grandson, who the Taliban had vowed to kidnap or kill during his second tour, said in a statement with other organisers of the Games."
458	"Americans Receive Over $850 Billion in Stimulus Checks; Spending Patterns Shift Towards Saving and Debt Payment

Americans have collectively received over $850 billion in stimulus checks through three relief packages aimed at mitigating the economic fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first stimulus check, distributed in April 2020, notably saw around 75% of recipients utilizing the funds for immediate household expenses, as the nation grappled with a surge in unemployment rates.

However, the spending patterns of Americans evolved with the subsequent disbursement of the second and third stimulus checks. According to data, recipients allocated a smaller percentage of the second check – 22% – towards essential expenses, with a larger focus on saving (26%) and paying off debts (51%). Similarly, the third stimulus check showed a trend towards saving (32%) and debt payment (49%), with only 19% being used for immediate spending needs.

The stimulus checks were particularly targeted towards low and middle-income households, with phased reductions in benefits for individuals earning above $75,000 annually. High-income households were more inclined to save or pay off debts with their stimulus funds, reflecting a strategy to bolster long-term financial stability.

The Economic Impact Payments, as the stimulus checks are officially known, have likely played a significant role in increasing personal income, consumer spending, savings, and overall economic growth during a period of severe economic uncertainty.

Despite growing calls for additional economic relief measures in the form of a fourth stimulus check, President Biden is currently focusing on advancing a new infrastructure package. While more than 80 members of Congress have expressed support for recurring $2,000 monthly stimulus checks until the end of the pandemic, the proposal lacks substantial backing at present.

It remains uncertain whether a fourth round of stimulus checks will materialize, with the administration's attention shifting towards broader economic recovery initiatives. The stimulus checks have undoubtedly provided crucial support to millions of Americans facing financial hardship, but their long-term efficacy and sustainability continue to be subjects of debate.

As the nation navigates through the ongoing economic challenges posed by the pandemic, the role of stimulus checks in stabilizing household finances and driving economic activity remains a topic of keen interest and scrutiny."
598	"Mega-Ship EVER ACE Triumphantly Navigates Suez Canal

The world's largest container ship, EVER ACE, has successfully traversed the Suez Canal on its maiden voyage, marking a significant milestone in maritime history. Built by Samsung Heavy Industries for Evergreen Marine Corporation, EVER ACE is the first of a series of 12 colossal container ships commissioned by Evergreen.

With a staggering carrying capacity of 23,992 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), EVER ACE eclipses the previous record-holder, HMM Algeciras. Its colossal dimensions include a length of 400 meters, a width of 61.53 meters, and an approximate weight of 235,000 tons. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) meticulously guided the ship's passage, ensuring its safe navigation through the vital waterway.

EVER ACE's successful transit underscores the Suez Canal's capability to accommodate the largest container ships in operation. The ship commenced its maiden voyage from the Port of Taipei, Taiwan, and is destined for Rotterdam, Netherlands, where it is anticipated to arrive on September 4.

Evergreen Marine Corporation, the owner of EVER ACE, also operates the infamous Ever Given, which famously blocked the Suez Canal in March 2021, causing widespread global trade disruptions. The successful passage of EVER ACE demonstrates the company's commitment to efficient and reliable maritime transportation.

The arrival of EVER ACE represents a significant advancement in the shipping industry, enabling the transport of vast quantities of goods with greater efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Its maiden voyage through the Suez Canal further highlights the strategic importance of the waterway for global trade and commerce."
1960	"Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Shines in Phase 3 Trials with 90.4% Efficacy and 100% Protection against Severe Disease

In a significant breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19, the Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) has demonstrated impressive results in a Phase 3 clinical trial. The trial, known as PREVENT-19, was funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and enrolled 29,960 volunteers in the U.S. and Mexico. The study showed that the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 90.4% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections.

The trial results were even more promising when it came to protection against moderate and severe disease. NVX-CoV2373 showed 100% efficacy in preventing these more severe cases of COVID-19. This is particularly significant as severe disease can lead to hospitalization and even death.

The vaccine also proved effective in high-risk individuals, including those aged 65 or older and those under 65 with certain comorbidities. NVX-CoV2373 showed an efficacy rate of 91.0% in this population. These findings are particularly important as older adults and those with underlying health conditions are at greater risk for severe disease and complications from COVID-19.

The most common side effects reported in the trial were mild-to-moderate injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain, which lasted less than two days. These side effects are similar to those reported with other COVID-19 vaccines and are generally considered to be mild and short-lived.

The PREVENT-19 trial used a 2:1 ratio for vaccine to placebo distribution and maintained a study blind to ensure that participants and investigators did not know who received the vaccine. The study results were based on 77 symptomatic COVID-19 cases observed, with 63 in the placebo group and 14 in the vaccine group.

NVX-CoV2373 uses recombinant protein nanoparticle technology and includes an adjuvant to enhance the immune response. This technology is different from the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. In May 2021, the PREVENT-19 trial expanded to include adolescents aged 12-17. The COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) and various health organizations are involved in facilitating and overseeing the trial. With these promising results, NVX-CoV2373 is poised to become another valuable tool in the global fight against COVID-19."
1769	"Tiger Woods injuries: Explaining Tiger's recovery from February car accident

Nine months ago, no one could have expected Tiger Woods to tee it up at all, let alone in public, at a tournament, on the Golf Channel. But that's where we are this week as Woods competes in the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie, at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando.

What can we expect from Woods this week, and the rest of the year? It all depends on his body. That's been his truth for awhile, and will be his truth going forward — ""It's my reality and I've accepted it,"" Woods told Golf Digest recently. Woods suffered open fractures to both the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg. Less serious but concurrent damage occurred with Woods' ankle and soft tissue in his lower leg. And less than a year later, he's clearly able to peg it in a reasonable way right now.

When Woods hosted 20 of the best players in the world at the Hero World Challenge earlier this month, he clued us in a bit to where his body is at, and what his rehab process has been like. Woods was largely bedridden for three months following the surgeries to his lower body, but he did walk with crutches about two months after the accident, by his estimate. He also admitted that he probably walked without crutches a bit earlier than his doctors advised him to.

In the months that followed the accident, Woods said, he was gracious just to go outside and feel the sun on his face. ""It's hard to explain how difficult it has been just to be immobile for the three months, just lay there and I was just looking forward to getting outside.""

Woods' recovery, in terms of golf, has meant chipping and putting in his backyard, and playing short-game competitions against Charlie. Positive as that may be, Woods noted that he is not able to grind through practice sessions like he used to, like during his comeback prior to this one.

""I don't foresee this leg ever being what it used to be, hence I'll never have the back what it used to be, and clock's ticking,"" Woods told reporters. ""I'm getting older, I'm not getting any younger. All that combined means that a full schedule and a full practice schedule and the recovery that it would take to do that, no, I don't have any desire to do that.""

Despite the uphill battle he still has ahead of him, Woods did practice repeatedly during the week in the Bahamas. He spent multiple days during the course of the tournament hitting full swing shots — even drivers — on the end of the driving range. So, how would he guess his future looks competing with his body on the PGA Tour? Woods has decided to invoke the story of Ben Hogan, who survived an auto accident to return and win at the highest level of the game."

1935	"While Texas is still recovering from the Winter Storm Uri, another winter storm is heading in from the north.

Texas is most at risk.

NERC says there's a 37% shortfall in energy supplies in the state.

Texas has already experienced its worst winter weather in decades. Winter Storm Uri has knocked out power to nearly three million Texans, left millions without heat, and caused billions of dollars worth of damage, according to the region's governor. Winter Storm Uri, which hit Texas last month with blizzard-style winds, was the first winter storm in more than a decade to hit the state with winds of at least 40 mph. And while the impact of Uri has subsided, another storm is heading in from the north. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) warns Texas is most at risk, potentially facing a 37% energy shortfall, per Business Insider, which notes that this could leave residents in the state without power for months. While most of Texas is likely to be spared the kind of power outages experienced by the Northeast in recent years, the threat from the coming winter weather may not go away. ""We are aware of the situation in Texas and are working hard with our energy suppliers and regulators,"" NERC's executive vice president Mark Olson said in a statement. ""We are confident that our suppliers can take the necessary steps to mitigate this threat."" The Texas A&M University hurricane expert said that after Winter Storm Uri, a second storm like this could come from the north, but that there was no evidence such a storm was on the horizon. He said the energy demand would be lower, so there would be no need for emergency generators. Aside from the potential for widespread power outages, the report from the NERC also comes on the heels of an uptick in the number of lawsuits being brought against the power company. Some of the lawsuits allege that the company, ERCOT, had a ""willful"" refusal to reduce the load on its lines, leaving some communities in Texas in the dark when the storm hit. ""We are confident that our suppliers can take the necessary steps to mitigate this threat,"" NERC's Olson said. ""We are confident in the resilience of our systems.""

541	"CNN's Chris Cuomo Under Fire for Interviews with Brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Amid Nursing Home Death Scandal

NEW YORK (AP) – Chris Cuomo, a prominent CNN journalist and brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is facing criticism for his interviews with his brother amid a scandal involving the undercounting of COVID-19 deaths of nursing home residents.

Cuomo's interviews with his brother last spring were characterized by their lighthearted banter, but are now being criticized as inappropriate and creating a conflict of interest. Critics argue that by interviewing his brother, Cuomo was unlikely to ask tough questions, and that the interviews gave the appearance of a cozy relationship between the governor and the journalist.

""It's a clear conflict of interest, and it undermines the credibility of both Chris Cuomo and CNN,"" said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University. ""Journalists should be able to cover their subjects without any perceived bias or favoritism.""

CNN has banned Chris Cuomo from interviewing or covering stories about his brother, a policy that was temporarily lifted in 2020. However, the network has continued to cover the nursing home death scandal on programs other than Cuomo's, with anchors openly inviting the governor to respond.

""It's important for CNN to maintain its journalistic integrity, especially in situations where there are clear conflicts of interest,"" said Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN's ""The Lead."" ""Governor Cuomo made a bad decision that may have cost lives, and it's important for him to be held accountable.""

The Cuomo administration has been accused of undercounting COVID-19 deaths of nursing home residents to avoid blame for policies that led to the spread of the virus in these facilities. New York's attorney general reported the administration's undercounting of deaths, and the governor has blamed nursing home staff for the virus spread. However, an Andrew Cuomo aide admitted that the administration withheld the true nursing home death toll out of fear it would be used against them by the Trump Justice Department.

""It's unacceptable for any administration to hide data or mislead the public during a public health crisis,"" said Tapper. ""CNN will continue to cover this story and hold those in power accountable, regardless of any conflicts of interest.""

Chris Cuomo has defended his interviews with his brother as significant and entertaining, but has followed CNN's policy to not cover related scandals.

""I understand the criticism, but I believe my interviews with my brother were significant and entertaining,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""I will continue to follow CNN's policy and not cover any related scandals.""

Despite the criticism, CNN has continued to cover the nursing home death scandal on programs other than Cuomo's, with anchors openly inviting the governor to respond.

""It's important for CNN to maintain its journalistic integrity and hold those in power accountable, even in situations where there are conflicts of interest,"" said Tapper. ""We will continue to cover this story and ensure that the public has access to accurate and unbiased information."""
1675	"Turkey bans advertising on Twitter and Pinterest under social media law

NGOs have warned that social networks risk ""becoming instruments of state censorship"" in Turkey under the legislation.

Turkey has banned several social networks, including Twitter, from advertising after they failed to establish a representative in the country under law.

The ban follows the passing of a new law in Turkey in October, which forced social networks to remove content at the request of the authorities and maintain a legal presence in the country.

Twitter's live video-sharing application Periscope and the social network Pinterest have also been banned from advertising revenue, according to a decision published in the Turkish Official Gazette.

Critics of the law say the legislation amounts to censorship of online content after the government had previously tightened its grip on mainstream media following a coup attempt in 2016.

But Turkey's Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, Omer Fatih Sayan, defended the law on Twitter, saying it was aimed at fighting ""digital fascism"".

""We are committed to doing whatever it takes to protect your data, privacy, and rights,"" Sayan tweeted, adding ""harassment, abuse, slander and rights violations are not a freedom but a crime"".

The deputy minister also expressed hope that Twitter and Pinterest would obey the regulations, otherwise risking a reduction in bandwidth in Turkey.

Turkish authorities have planned to halve the bandwidth of companies that contradict the law by April and then further reduce it by 90 per cent in May, making them effectively inaccessible.

""We do not want any of our citizens to be deprived of the services provided in our country,"" said Sayan.

Before the ban on advertising revenue came into force, Facebook stated that it would appoint a representative in Turkey but reaffirmed its commitment to freedom of expression. Other platforms including YouTube and TikTok have abided by the legislation.

Amnesty International has warned the social media companies risk ""becoming instruments of state censorship"" in Turkey.

""We are calling on social media companies not to contribute to Turkey's censorship of online content and not to expose users to the risk of arbitrary arrest and prosecution by handing over their private data to Turkish authorities,"" added Sarah Clarke, Article 19's Head of Europe and Central Asia Programme.

Turkey has so far fined social media platforms 40 million Turkish liras (€4.4 million) for non-compliance with the law.

The country's government passed the legislation in July, less than one month after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called for a ""cleaning up"" of social networks."

1324	"Deep freeze sends Texas electricity prices soaring 10,000%

Tonight: Global banks are, once again, learning about the dangers of excessive leverage; the Great Stuck may be unstuck, but the Suez saga isn't over; and the housing market has truly gone bonkers. Let's get into it.

FROZEN OVER

Unthinkably cold temperatures have knocked Texas' energy facilities offline.

Electricity prices spiked more than 10,000% when the winter storm hit this week. There are blackouts across the state. More than 4 million Texans were without power early Tuesday.

POINTING FINGERS

Although some are attempting to pin the blame on one fuel source or another, the reality is that the Arctic temperatures are hobbling fossil fuels and renewable energy alike, my colleague Matt Egan explains.

It's striking that these power outages are happening in mighty Texas, the energy powerhouse of America. A bit of context:

Texas produces more electricity than any other US state — generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.

Texas is the No. 1 state in both crude oil and natural gas.

Wind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019.

WHAT HAPPENED?

So how did such a powerhouse get knocked so thoroughly offline?

We may not know the full definitive reason for a while, but a few things are clear:

Obviously, Texas winters ain't usually this cold. The state's infrastructure is simply not prepared for a deep freeze.

Critics of renewables will try to blame wind turbines, but experts note that wind makes up a small share of Texas' energy consumption.

It's also worth poinitng out that a lot of chillier places have wind turbines that don't buckle in the cold — hello, Iowa; hej hej, Denmark — they just need to be winterized, a step experts said Texas has skipped.

The Lone Star State is ... all alone. Texas made a conscious decision to isolate its energy grid from the rest of the country. That means that when things are running smoothly, it can't export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current crisis, it can't import power either.

In other words: ""When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas,"" said Dan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University. ""That has really come back to bite us.""

QUOTE OF THE DAY

To believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion — would have been borderline irrational.

— US District Court Judge Jesse Furman

Citi just lost a bid to fix a major oopsie. Last year, the bank fat-fingered $900 million to lenders for cosmetics company Revlon. Some lenders returned the erroneous funds, but others refused, prompting Citi to sue to recover half a billion dollars. On Tuesday, a federal judge said — and I'm paraphrasing here — lol no.

Another day, another escalation of the Chicken Sandwich Wars. At this point, you gotta do something special to make your sandwich stand out, so McDonald's is building buzz for its three new chickie sammies with a limited edition $5 swag bundle, which includes a hoodie, a vinyl recording of a custom song and, of course, a sandwich. (The star has got to be the hoodie, which comes in a hue that I can best describe as a ""light fried chicken color."")

BIG VEGAN

Now for basically the opposite of chicken sandwiches: We have vegan KitKats now. Instead of dairy, KitKat V will use a rice-based alternative. Healthier? Nah. But more inclusive of people who eat plant-based diets? Yes!

Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $50,000 on Tuesday. That statement might have sounded like a joke a year ago, when the crypto cost $10,000. But bitcoin has skyrocketed during the pandemic thanks to rock-bottom interest rates that have severely weakened the US dollar. That makes bitcoin, a comparatively attractive currency.

166	"Derek Chauvin pleads not guilty to federal charges

CNN — Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted in April on state murder charges for killing George Floyd, pleaded not guilty on Thursday in a federal case related to the use of unreasonable force on a 14-year-old in September 2017.

Chauvin was arraigned via video conference before US District Magistrate Judge Hildy Bowbeer on two counts of federal civil rights violations. He declined to have the charges read against him in court.

The ex-cop wore a tan shirt in what appeared to be a conference room – a yellow pad in front of him – at Minnesota's maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights outside of Minneapolis, where he's serving a 22 1/2-year sentence for Floyd's murder. He spoke briefly, answering short procedural questions and entering his plea.

A federal grand jury indicted Chauvin and three other former officers in May for allegedly violating Floyd's constitutional rights.

Chauvin also was charged in the separate indictment involving the Minneapolis 14-year-old in September 2017, according to the Justice Department.

The first count of that indictment said Chauvin ""held the teenager by the throat and struck the teenager multiple times in the head with a flashlight,"" the DOJ said in a statement at the time.

A second count said the former officer ""held his knee on the neck and the upper back of the teenager even after the teenager was lying prone, handcuffed, and unresisting, also resulting in bodily injury.""

Chauvin is accused of willfully depriving the teenager's ""constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer,"" according to a DOJ statement at the time.

Floyd's death on May 25, 2020, ignited nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.

Bystander video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds while the 46-year-old, handcuffed and lying prone in the street, gasped for air, telling the officers, ""I can't breathe.""

Chauvin and former officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges stemming from Floyd's death.

Chauvin is accused of depriving Floyd's right to be free from ""unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer.""

Thao and Kueng also were charged in connection with their failure to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, according to the indictment. Chauvin, Thao, Kueng and Lane also face a charge for failing to give Floyd medical aid.

The indictment said ""the defendants saw George Floyd lying on the ground in clear need of medical care, and willfully failed to aid Floyd, thereby acting with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to Floyd.""

Trial dates have not been set in the federal cases.

Separately, Thao, Kueng and Lane are charged in a state court for aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. They have pleaded not guilty.

Thao, Kueng and Lane were on the scene with Chauvin when Floyd was killed.

The federal charges against the ex-cops are separate from a civil investigation into Minneapolis policing practices announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland in April."
1569	"Why Facebook Outage and Twitch Breach Matter to Business Leaders

FREDERICK, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In brief video explainers and commentary, Josh Stella, co-founder and CEO of Fugue, a cloud security SaaS company, talks to business and security leaders about why outages and breaches like the recent Facebook and Twitch incidents keep happening, how cloud configuration is the new attack surface, and how companies need to move from a defensive to a preventive posture to secure their cloud infrastructure.

This month, Facebook and Twitch both suffered serious damage at their own hands, and every executive needs to understand what happened and how these types of incidents are preventable.

At Facebook, a network configuration change took the service down for hours — and WhatsApp and Instagram along with it — resulting in tens of millions in lost revenue and millions of users unable to access these services.

At Twitch, an interactive live streaming service owned by Amazon, a server misconfiguration gave a hacker access to a trove of sensitive data, including information on users and source code for yet-to-be-released applications, which the hacker posted on the internet.

In the past year alone, 36% of companies suffered a serious cloud security leak or breach due to cloud misconfiguration, according to The State of Cloud Security 2021 Report.

We've seen enterprise cloud customers fall victim to their own preventable configuration mistakes many times before. What's notable here is that Facebook and Twitch are essentially customers of their own cloud platforms. When you consider how much complexity the cloud providers have pushed to their customers, these incidents keep happening — not because people are bad at cloud security but because it's really hard to get good at it. Let's explore that.

Why Cloud Risk Is Configuration Risk

The cloud attack surface is configuration, not the network. Configuration is essentially how you've designed and built your infrastructure. The word ""configuration"" can feel like a small detail, but in the cloud, configuration is a big deal. A mistake here can create vulnerabilities and break applications. A single misconfiguration can have a huge blast radius in terms of system downtime or a data breach — and the resulting loss of revenue and customer trust.

Take a car, for example. A car has an engine, a transmission, wheels, etc. All of these components have configurations, some of which are related to safety and regulated by law. People and machines inspected the configurations of the car before it rolled off the line, which the owner may have changed over time. A safety inspector flags configuration violations because bad configuration can cause a breakdown or an accident."
993	"Did US Navy SEALs Rescue Trafficked Children from Ever Given Ship?

Claim: Over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies were rescued by U.S. Navy SEALs out of shipping containers on Evergreen's Ever Given cargo ship after it became stuck in the Suez Canal. Rating: About this rating False

In early April 2021, a seemingly endless number of social media users copied and pasted a purported breaking news story about the ship that was famously stuck for days in the Suez Canal. Most of the posts began with the same sentence: ""Over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals."" The story referenced the Evergreen cargo ship Ever Given, which became stuck in the Suez Canal in March and caused a major maritime traffic jam that took days to clear after the ship was freed.

The source of the text appeared to be Before It's News, a dubious website that has consistently published content not rooted in facts. For example, the unreliable website once falsely claimed Pope Francis had been found guilty of child trafficking and murder.

Regarding the Ever Given ship and the purported U.S. Navy SEALs rescue, the full story on Before It's News bore the headline: ""Trafficked Children, Bodies, Weapons Found on Evergreen Ship Blocking Suez Canal."" In addition to being posted on Facebook, the misleading content was also shared on TikTok.

The introduction of the article read as follows:

Over a thousand trafficked children and dead bodies have been rescued out of shipping containers in the Suez Canal by US Navy Seals. Sources say that as of this writing, children were still being rescued and bodies discovered in Evergreen's 18,000+ containers. The containers were on an Evergreen Corporation ship that blocked the Canal from Tues. 23 March to Mon 29 March, causing billions in lost revenue to shipping companies internationally. The Seals also found Weapons of Mass Destruction on the six story high vessel – which were believed destined to start a war in the Middle East. Finally by Tues. the Evergreen cargo ship was loosened and taken to Bitter Lake in Egypt. By order of the Egyptian President, the containers were taken off the ship and searched by US Navy Seals. The Japanese-owned, Taiwanese-operated ship of Evergreen Corporation was actually co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation – known for it's international child trafficking ring. The children were said ordered out of magazines like Wayfair by pedophiles who paid big bucks for certain abused children.

The rest of the article mentioned ""weapons of mass destruction"" and included a purported ""telegram"" that read: ""Ever Given has been boarded by the US Navy Seals and they have opened several cargo containers with live and dead inside. The vessel is in Bitter Lake and the Navy is performing unloading procedures. No images will be leaked, but I have been sent one.""

The entire story was false.

One Facebook user who shared the baseless article posted: ""YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP!!"" That was also false.

Not one credible news publisher across the world reported anything similar. If such a story had any basis in fact, it is unlikely that coverage of the massive breaking news event would be limited to a single obscure website that had a history of publishing false and misleading content.

The mention of the Clinton Foundation in the story might remind readers of a somewhat similar, debunked claim involving former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Ever Given cargo ship."
595	"Security Council Demands Taliban Ensure Safe Passage out of Afghanistan, Condemns Deadly Kabul Attack

The United Nations Security Council has demanded that the Taliban ensure safe passage out of Afghanistan and prevent the country from being used as a shelter for terrorism, in response to the deadly attack at Kabul airport by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP).

In a resolution mainly pushed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France, the Security Council strongly condemned the attack, which killed over 150 people and injured more than 200 others. The resolution emphasized the importance of safe passage for Afghans and foreign nationals at any time, and called for all parties to facilitate humanitarian assistance with safe and unhindered access.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, ""The United States will continue to work with our international partners to ensure the safety and security of those who remain in Afghanistan, and to hold the Taliban accountable for their commitments.""

Deputy Permanent Representative of France Nathalie Estival-Broadhurst stressed the importance of protecting human rights and the gains made over the past two decades. ""The international community must remain vigilant in protecting the rights of all Afghans, particularly women, children, and minorities,"" she said.

UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward echoed these sentiments, stating, ""The United Kingdom will continue to work with our international partners to ensure that the gains made in Afghanistan over the past two decades are not lost, and that the rights of all Afghans are protected.""

Russia abstained from voting on the resolution, citing its failure to address concerns about combating international terrorism. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia stated, ""We cannot support a resolution that does not fully take into account the concerns of all members of the international community regarding the threat of terrorism.""

China emphasized the chaos in Afghanistan is tied to the disorderly withdrawal of foreign troops and called for reflection. Ambassador Geng Shuang said, ""The current situation in Afghanistan is a reminder that the withdrawal of foreign troops must be done in an orderly and responsible manner.""

The resolution seeks to hold the Taliban accountable to their commitments as judged by their actions. The US has evacuated over 122,000 people from Afghanistan since July, and continues to work with international partners to ensure the safety and security of those who remain in the country.

In conclusion, the Security Council's resolution highlights the international community's commitment to ensuring safe passage out of Afghanistan and preventing the country from being used as a shelter for terrorism. The resolution also emphasizes the importance of protecting human rights and the gains made over the past two decades, and seeks to hold the Taliban accountable to their commitments.

The full text of the resolution can be found on the UN News website."
549	"Security Council urges Taliban to provide safe passage out of Afghanistan

Thirteen of the 15 ambassadors voted in favour of the resolution, which further demands that Afghanistan not be used as a shelter for terrorism.

Airport attack condemned

Countries condemned in the strongest terms the deadly blasts at Kabul airport on Thursday, which killed more than 150 people and injured upwards of 200 more. The terrorist group Islamic State in Khorosan Province (ISKP) claimed responsibility.

The attack targeted people fleeing Afghanistan in the wake of the Taliban's takeover two weeks ago, and international forces assisting the evacuations.

Thousands of Afghans have been trying to escape from the country ahead of the full withdrawal of the United States by its self-imposed Tuesday deadline.

USA: Live up to commitment

The resolution was tabled by the United States, alongside fellow permanent Council members France and the United Kingdom.

""The Security Council expects the Taliban to live up to its commitment to facilitate safe passage for Afghans and foreign nationals who want to leave Afghanistan, whether it's today, tomorrow, or after August 31,"" said US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

""Consistent with the right to leave any country, including one's own, everybody must be allowed to safely leave Afghanistan, for whatever reason, whenever they want, by air or by land. This is of the utmost importance to us.""

Since July, the USA has evacuated more than 122,000 Americans, foreign nationals and at-risk Afghan citizens, she reported. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield added that the resolution also reflects the Council's ""crystal clear"" commitment to assisting those who remain in Afghanistan.

""It underscores that all parties need to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and that humanitarian actors be given full safe and unhindered access to continue service delivery to those in need,"" she said.

France: Reach all in need

The resolution takes note of a Taliban statement this week which allows Afghans to leave the country at any time. Nathalie Estival-Broadhurst, Deputy Permanent Representative of France, called for that commitment to be upheld.

""This resolution calls on everyone to make all efforts to secure the airport and the surrounding area.,"" she said, speaking through an interpreter.

""And to create this safe passage and protection is a sine qua non condition to ensure that threatened Afghans who wish to leave can do so safely, but also to ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach all of those who need it through the airport, of course, but also over land borders.""

UK: Protect rights gains

On the issue of human rights, UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward emphasized the need to protect gains made over the past two decades, stressing that the rights of women, children and minorities must be safeguarded.

She described the resolution as an important step towards a unified international response to the situation in Afghanistan.

""We will continue to build on this to ensure the Council holds the Taliban accountable on its commitments. The Taliban will be judged by the international community on the basis of their actions on the ground, not their words,"" she stated.

Russia: Concerns not included

In explaining his vote, Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia was forced to abstain because certain ""principled concerns"" were not reflected in the draft text, which was circulated on Friday."

1329	"It's final: Harry and Meghan won't return as working royals

LONDON (AP) — Buckingham Palace confirmed Friday that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, will not be returning to royal duties, and Harry will give up his honorary military titles — a decision that makes formal, and final, the couple's split from the royal family.

When Harry and Meghan stepped away from full-time royal life in March 2020, unhappy at media scrutiny and the strictures of their roles, it was agreed the situation would be reviewed after a year.

Now it has, and the palace said in a statement that the couple, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have verified ""they will not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. ""

It said Queen Elizabeth II had spoken to 36-year-old Harry and confirmed ""that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family, it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service.""

The palace said Harry's appointment as captain general of the Royal Marines and titles with other military groups would revert to the queen before being distributed to other members of the family.

Harry served in the British army for a decade, including on the front line in Afghanistan, and retains a close bond with the military. He founded the Invictus Games competition for wounded troops, which first was held in 2014 at London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

The Invictus Games Foundation said Harry would remain its patron. But he is relinquishing positions as patron of the Rugby Football Union, the Rugby Football League and the London Marathon Charitable Trust.

Meghan, 39, will be stripped of her role as patron of Britain's National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family,"" the palace statement said.

American actress Meghan Markle, a former star of the TV legal drama ""Suits,"" married the queen's grandson Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born a year later.

In early 2020, Meghan and Harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media toward the duchess, who identifies as biracial.

The couple agreed to no longer use the title ""royal highness"" or receive public funds for their work, although it was unclear at the time if those decisions would stand.

They retain their titles of duke and duchess, and Harry is still sixth in line to the British throne. Harry and Meghan now live in Santa Barbara, California and are expecting their second child. The couple recently announced they would speak to Oprah Winfrey for a TV special to be broadcast next month."
1385	"Colin Powell's Private Funeral: A Missed Opportunity for National Reflection

On October 18, 2021, Washington National Cathedral hosted the funeral of General Colin Powell, a distinguished American statesman and the first Black Secretary of State. Powell's death from complications of COVID-19 marked the loss of a remarkable figure, yet his funeral remained a private affair, devoid of the public mourning rituals typically accorded to individuals of his stature.

The absence of a state funeral or the customary lying in state at the U.S. Capitol, as per Powell's or his family's wishes, limited public involvement and the opportunity for collective reflection on his legacy. This decision, while understandable in light of personal preferences and the ongoing pandemic, raises questions about the significance of public mourning rituals and their role in fostering national unity.

Powell's achievements, including his groundbreaking role as the nation's top diplomat, his military leadership, and his dedication to public service, epitomize the kind of figure traditionally honored with a public mourning ritual in the United States. These rituals have historically served as a means for Americans to express collective grief, pay tribute to exceptional individuals, and contemplate the nation's shared values and aspirations.

Public funerals in the U.S. have evolved over time, becoming more inclusive and representative of the nation's diverse population. In recent decades, they have honored not only white male politicians and leaders but also Black Americans and women, reflecting a broader recognition of the contributions of all citizens to the nation's fabric.

Colin Powell, with his distinguished career and bipartisan respect, undoubtedly merited a full public mourning ritual. His life and accomplishments transcended political divides, making him a symbol of unity and a source of inspiration for Americans across the ideological spectrum.

Yet, Powell's funeral did not become a public event, possibly due to his characteristic humility, his family's wishes, or concerns over the potential for political or health-related complications. While these considerations are valid, the absence of public mourning rituals for Powell represents a missed opportunity to honor his contributions fully and to engage in collective reflection on the COVID-19 pandemic, which claimed his life.

Powell's death and its commemoration underscore the challenges in achieving unity and bipartisanship in the current political climate. The decision to forgo public mourning rituals reflects a broader societal fragmentation, where divisions often overshadow common ground.

As we grapple with these challenges, it is essential to recognize the value of public mourning rituals in fostering a sense of national cohesion and shared purpose. These rituals provide a space for citizens to come together, transcend partisan differences, and reflect on the lives and legacies of those who have made significant contributions to the nation.

In the case of Colin Powell, his private funeral limited the opportunity for such collective reflection. While we honor his wishes and respect his family's privacy, we must also acknowledge the significance of public mourning rituals in shaping our national narrative and promoting unity in a divided society."

WHO today validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities the assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing. The vaccine is produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac.

""The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,"" said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products. ""We urge manufacturers to participate in the COVAX Facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.""

WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.

The EUL assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements. The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions.

In the case of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.

The Sinovac-CoronaVac product is an inactivated vaccine. Its easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings.

WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population.

Few older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons. There is no reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations. WHO recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to verify the expected impact and contribute to making the recommendation more robust for all countries.

WHO emergency use listing

The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks."
222	"Tom Brady Opens Up About His Reservations During Super Bowl LV Victory Parade

In a recent interview with Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady expressed some reservations about his decision to toss the Lombardi Trophy during the Super Bowl LV victory parade. The incident occurred during a waterway parade on the Hillsborough River in Tampa, Florida, after the Buccaneers won the Super Bowl in 2021.

""I was a little hesitant at first, I'm not gonna lie,"" Brady admitted. ""I didn't want to drop the trophy, and I was worried about the sharp edges posing a risk to people nearby.""

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers opted for a boat parade instead of a traditional parade due to COVID-19 precautions. Brady mentioned having fun during the celebration but acknowledged he is not comfortable with public attention and prefers staying home.

""I'm a pretty private person, so being in the public eye all the time can be challenging,"" Brady said. ""But it's part of the job, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to play the game I love.""

Brady credited his wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, for the strength of their marriage and for making many sacrifices. The couple shares two children, Benjamin Rein (11) and Vivian Lake (8). Brady also has a 13-year-old son, John Edward, with ex Bridget Moynahan.

""Gisele has been an incredible partner and support system for me,"" Brady said. ""She's made many sacrifices for our family, and I'm grateful for everything she does.""

Brady emphasized the importance of keeping his children grounded and making sure they understand the need to work hard.

""My kids are growing up in a unique environment, and it's important to me that they understand the value of hard work and making their own impact in the world,"" Brady said. ""I want them to be good people, and that's what matters most to me.""

Bündchen shared her own thoughts on the matter, stating, ""I think it's important for our children to see us working hard and pursuing our passions. It's important for them to understand that success doesn't come easily, and that it takes dedication and perseverance.""

In conclusion, Tom Brady's reservations during the Super Bowl LV victory parade are understandable, given his private nature and concerns for safety. However, his commitment to his family and his desire to instill good values in his children are admirable. As one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, Brady continues to make a positive impact both on and off the field."

746	"QAnon Shaman' Jacob Chansley Receives 41-Month Sentence for Capitol Riot Involvement, Marking Longest Among Guilty Defendants

Jacob Chansley, widely known as the ""QAnon shaman,"" was sentenced to 41 months in prison by Judge Royce Lamberth for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot. Chansley, who pleaded guilty to a single count of obstructing a proceeding of Congress, expressed genuine remorse, according to Lamberth. Although his sentence is on the lower end of federal guidelines, it matches the longest among Capitol riot defendants who have pleaded guilty. Prosecutor Kimberly Paschall argued for a 51-month sentence, citing Chansley's early and prominent participation in the riot, while the defense sought a lighter sentence due to Chansley's remorse and mental health issues. Referring to Chansley's conduct, Paschall said, ""It does not get more disturbing than that,"" emphasizing the gravity of his actions. During the sentencing hearing, a video of Chansley howling inside Congress was presented, with Paschall describing it as ""chilling."" Chansley's defense team acknowledged the severity of the offense but emphasized that their client is not a violent man or a domestic terrorist. Chansley, in his statement to the court, cited various figures and works as lessons for his repentance but stressed that he is not a violent man or a domestic terrorist. Despite his expressions of remorse, Chansley's actions on January 6 were criticized for undermining the peaceful transfer of presidential power."
1627	"Celebrating Derek Chauvin's conviction is not enough. We want to live | Derecka Purnell

A jury has found Derek Chauvin guilty of all charges against him for killing George Floyd, including unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. A judge remanded Chauvin in custody after the verdict and a cop quickly cuffed the dazed defendant to carry him out of the courtroom. Chauvin will remain in jail until his sentencing hearing in two months.

Presidents did what presidents do after the criminal justice system seems to work for the people who it exploits, but this time with a twist. Neither Obama nor Biden considered the verdict justice, but rather accountability and ""a step in the right direction"". Obama emphasized eliminating racial bias in policing and implementing concrete reforms for change; Biden explained that the verdict was a giant step forward towards justice in America.

There are two fatal flaws with these statements. The first is that reforms cannot fix racial bias in policing because police was formed as a system of racial and economic control, and remains so. As I've written before: if Derek Chauvin were the kindest cop in Minnesota and did not have a biased bone in his body, he still would have been able to arrest George Floyd for any number of alleged illegal acts. Because of capitalism, racism and ableism, the darkest and poorest peoples in the United States are relegated to live precarious lives where they do what they can to survive, sometimes including breaking the law. Rather than eliminating the unjust conditions, cities and the federal government send in police to manage the inequality.

Additionally, even if we could remove racial bias from police, this would not solve the underlying problems of inequality and exploitation. If it did, then there wouldn't be so many poor, white people in prison. Last week, I watched a video of three cops arresting and slamming a 73-year-old white woman with dementia who was picking flowers on her way home. She'd forgotten to pay for her groceries at Walmart. Police dislocated her shoulder, and tied her hands and feet like a hog. She repeatedly cried that she wanted to go home and they chuckled at her. If removing racial bias in police is supposed to ensure that that Black people will be treated like white people under the law, then equal protection is completely insufficient for anyone's freedom and safety.

Additionally, we cannot expect cop convictions to save anyone's lives because prior cop convictions did not even save George Floyd's life. Thousands of cops have killed more than 10,000 people of all races between 2005 and 2017; only 82 cops have been charged with murder or manslaughter. According to criminologist Phil Stinson, only 19 cops were convicted and mostly on lesser charges in that time period. A judge sentenced former South Carolina cop Michael Slaeger to 20 years in prison in 2017 for shooting Walter Scott several times in the back. A judge sentenced former Chicago PD officer Jason Van Dyke in 2019 to a little over six years in prison for fatally shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times. Despite the increasing convictions, the police nationwide still kill about three people a day. Just a few years ago, Minnesota convicted a cop for a murder while on duty for the first time. Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor was sentenced to about 12 years. Why didn't all of these convictions save the thousands of people who were killed after them? Why didn't Chauvin get the message?"
1111	"Twitter's Vijaya Gadde: The Woman Behind the Ban on Donald Trump

New York CNN Business – In a bold move that sparked widespread discussion on the power and responsibilities of social media platforms, Twitter banned former US President Donald Trump from its platform, and the woman behind the decision is none other than Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's head of legal, policy, and trust.

Gadde, who has been with Twitter since 2009, has played a central role in confronting Trump's incitement of violence on the platform. In an interview with CNN, Gadde emphasized that Twitter's decision to ban Trump was not taken lightly. ""We took this decision very seriously, and we felt that it was necessary to protect the health of the public conversation on our platform,"" she said.

Adam Bain, former COO of Twitter, praised Gadde's leadership in the decision-making process. ""Vijaya is a thoughtful and principled leader who has always put the safety and well-being of Twitter's users first,"" he said. ""Her expertise in legal and policy matters has been invaluable to the company, and her influence within the tech industry is undeniable.""

Gadde's influence extends beyond Twitter's walls. Under her leadership, Twitter has been involved in global policy decisions, interacting with governments and advocating for openness and trust. Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, a Nigerian social enterprise, commended Twitter's commitment to transparency. ""Twitter has shown that it is willing to take tough decisions to protect its users, even when it means facing regulatory challenges in other countries,"" he said.

However, Twitter's decision to ban Trump has sparked regulatory challenges in other countries, including India and Nigeria. In Nigeria, Twitter was banned after removing a controversial tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari. In India, Twitter is navigating complex legal challenges after refusing to fully comply with government requests to censor accounts.

Despite these challenges, Gadde remains optimistic about Twitter's role in shaping media and politics. ""We recognize that our platform has a significant impact on the way people communicate and access information, and we take that responsibility seriously,"" she said. ""We will continue to work with governments and advocacy groups to ensure that our platform remains a safe and open space for all users.""

Gadde's leadership at Twitter has been marked by a commitment to transparency and accountability. In 2018, she played a key role in the company's efforts to combat election interference and misinformation on the platform. Her work has earned her recognition as one of the most influential women in tech, and her impact on the industry will undoubtedly continue to be felt for years to come.

As Twitter faces regulatory challenges in various countries, Gadde's expertise in legal and policy matters will be crucial in navigating these complex issues. With her at the helm, Twitter is well-positioned to continue shaping the way we communicate and access information.

In conclusion, Vijaya Gadde's central role in the decision to ban Donald Trump from Twitter highlights her influence within the company and the tech industry as a whole. Her commitment to transparency, accountability, and user safety has earned her recognition and respect, and her leadership will continue to shape the future of social media and its impact on society."

1457	"Buccaneers' Game Plan Leads to Dominant Super Bowl LV Victory

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LV was a testament to the team's well-executed game plan, led by Offensive Coordinator Byron Leftwich. According to Leftwich, the key to success was identifying the opposing team's weaknesses and developing a strategy to exploit them.

""We knew the Chiefs had a strong pass rush, so we focused on play-action fakes and quick throws to get the ball out of Tom Brady's hands quickly,"" Leftwich explained. ""We also emphasized running the ball early in the game to establish a rhythm and wear down their defense.""

The Buccaneers' game plan certainly paid off, as Brady utilized play-action on 43% of his dropbacks, the highest in his career according to NFL Next Gen Stats. This strategy led to three touchdown passes and a near-perfect passer rating of 149.0.

In the first quarter alone, the Buccaneers ran or faked a handoff on 73% of their plays, reflecting a strategic emphasis on 'run action.' Brady's execution of the play-action plan was nearly flawless, with his targeted receivers having an average of 4.0 yards of separation, the best in any game during the season.

One of the most impressive plays of the game came in the second quarter, when Brady connected with tight end Rob Gronkowski for a 27-yard touchdown. Gronkowski, who has shown signs of declining speed in recent seasons, demonstrated both his remaining speed and successful improvisation with Brady on the play.

Brady's quick release time of 2.27 seconds on average also helped neutralize the Chiefs' pass rush, allowing him to get the ball out of his hands quickly and avoid sacks. In fact, Brady's average time to throw in the first half was the lowest since NFL Next Gen Stats began tracking in 2016.

Overall, the Buccaneers' game plan was a masterclass in exploiting the opposing team's weaknesses and executing a well-thought-out strategy. With Byron Leftwich at the helm, the Buccaneers are certainly a force to be reckoned with in the NFL."
1756	"Suez Canal shutdown shows the vulnerability of the global economy to extreme events

A critical global shipping node – Egypt's Suez Canal – was reopened on Monday, March 29, six days after being shut down when the 400-meter-long container ship Ever Given became lodged in the canal. A statement by the Suez Canal Authority initially blamed the incident on high winds and a sand storm that reduced visibility, but later said that strong winds were ""not the only cause,"" and that an investigation was ongoing.

There is no clear indication at this point that climate change played a role in the sandstorm that led to the ship's blocking the canal, but the incident raises intriguing questions that likely will prompt research into any correlation.

The multi-day shutdown of one of the world's busiest shipping chokepoints underscores the vulnerability of the global food system and economy to disruptions. That vulnerability is playing on the stage of increasingly extreme weather, rising seas, and an increasingly just-in-time world of shipping.

Figure 1. MODIS satellite image from March 23, 2021, the day of the grounding of the container ship Ever Given in the Suez Canal. A cold front over Egypt was causing a widespread dust storm that affected the Red Sea, Suez Canal, and waters of the Mediterranean Sea. (Image credit: NASA Worldview)

Meteorology of the event

The high winds and sand storm that contributed to the grounding incident were caused by a cold front trailing to the south of a low-pressure system centered near southern Turkey.

As the cold front swept eastwards across Egypt on March 23, powerful winds of 25-30 knots (29-35 mph) blew along the axis of the Red Sea from the south-southeast, into the southern end of the Suez Canal, as seen in the 6 UTC analysis from the GFS model (Figure 2). The Ever Given became stuck at 05:40 UTC that day. According to the GFS analysis, a sharp wind shift, with winds blowing out of the southwest to west, was present near the spot where the Ever Given blocked the canal, about five miles north of its connection with the Red Sea."
761	"A Damning New Report Finally Explains the Strangest Thing I Saw Inside the Capitol Riot

When I walked toward the Capitol on Jan. 6 alongside Donald Trump's supporters and heard some of them had breached the building ahead, I expected the situation to escalate sharply. I expected police in military gear and a response as aggressive as I've come to anticipate covering and observing protests over the past year, where a single water bottle thrown at a cop line can bring a volley of tear gas and percussion grenades in retaliation.

Instead, I easily walked into the Capitol perimeter. At the entrances to the building, there were a few Capitol Police officers helplessly trying to hold a line at the doors, but they were vastly outnumbered. The officers had somehow gotten the doors back closed, but within minutes, rioters were easily pushing past them again. Once I was inside, too, I saw no officers at all for a stretch, as rioters plundered and destroyed furniture. When I did, it was even more surreal: They looked as if they were there loitering themselves. Some were equipped with riot gear, others not, but most just stood there and watched. Some rioters stopped to ask them for directions. In one of the only direct interactions I saw, a Capitol officer asked a rioter to put out a cigarette, then walked away.

I'd never seen law enforcement show this level of restraint at any protest, much less a riot. And now we know why. A damning new report by the Capitol Police's own inspector general, Michael A. Bolton, presented at a Capitol Hill hearing today, portrays a police force that recklessly disregarded intelligence and hobbled its own response at every turn.

With around 140 officers injured and one dead, there was some passing of the buck in the immediate aftermath of the riot. Republicans were in denial. The former Capitol Police chief, Steven Sund, resigned almost immediately. He wrote in a letter, ""Perfect hindsight does not change the fact that nothing in our collective experience or our intelligence—Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and D.C. Metropolitan Police (MPD)—indicated that a well-coordinated, armed assault on the Capitol might occur on Jan. 6."" Sund repeated this assertion in testimony in front of a U.S. Senate committee just weeks ago: ""None of the intelligence we received predicted what actually occurred,"" he said.

That account stands in direct contrast to the new report, in which Bolton found that Capitol Police leadership dismissed threat assessments and forbade rank-and-file officers from appropriately responding to the threat. The New York Times reviewed a copy of the document and reported that the Capitol Police's own intelligence warned three days before that ""Congress itself is the target on the 6th."" There were warnings about who would be in the crowd: ""Stop the Steal's propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike."" Bolton's report also unearthed pre-insurrection warnings from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, which had relayed to the Capitol Police that a map of the Capitol's tunnel system had turned up on pro-Trump message boards.

But the 104-page report found that, rather than ramp up security, the officers on duty were ordered to carry only limited riot-prevention equipment and to not carry stun grenades. Bolton wrote that ""heavier less-lethal weapons were not used that day because of orders from leadership."" He added that the unit was ""operating at a decreased level of readiness as a result of a lack of standards for equipment"" that diminished ""operational readiness."""
809	"How Trump's second impeachment will be different from the first

CNN — The overall impeachment process laid out in the Constitution is relatively simple: President commits ""high Crime or Misdemeanor,"" House votes to impeach, Senate conducts a trial.

Those overall contours are constant. But there's no such thing as a routine impeachment.

The one President Donald Trump faces now, after inciting a riotous mob to attack the Capitol, is unprecedented in all sorts of ways, which means the process will feel entirely new and different from the one we saw in late 2019 around the Ukraine investigation.

Specifically, this House impeachment vote is likely to be done this week, and the Senate trial will occur after Trump leaves office.

Here's another look at the impeachment process as it is spelled out in the Constitution and how it applies to this second impeachment of Trump, in which a US President is accused for the first time of inciting violence against another branch of government.

What does the Constitution say about who can be impeached and for what reasons?

The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. (Article 2, Section 4)

What is Trump accused of doing?

There was a lot of debate during Trump's first impeachment and trial about whether the pressure he exerted on the President of Ukraine amounted to ""high Crimes and Misdemeanors"" or simply a set of policies.

This time, while there's an argument he committed treason, Democrats in the House have alleged Trump ""engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.""

The Article argues that Trump incited his supporters by repeatedly denying the election results in the lead-up to the counting of the electoral votes, that he pressured Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" additional votes for him, and in doing so he ""gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" ""threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.""

Read the entire thing here. It's short.

What does the Constitution say about the House's role?

The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. (Article 1, Section 2)

What does that mean for Trump this time?

Getting from Trump's misdeed to impeachment proceedings in the House took 86 days in 2019.

It's going to take just a week in 2021.

The House can essentially impeach at will. While there are precedents in place around instigating the impeachment process and utilizing House committees to investigate whether impeachable offenses occurred, none of that is necessarily required. And Democrats, moving quickly, aren't going to burden themselves by dragging this out.

And why bother with an investigation when this time Trump did it on TV? In that first effort, the details of Trump's pressure on Ukraine leaked out over the course of weeks and built into Democratic support to launch and conduct an investigation and, ultimately, to impeach him.

With Trump's time in office set to expire at noon on January 20, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also gave Trump and Vice President Mike Pence the option of avoiding impeachment if either Trump resigned or Pence mobilized the Cabinet to use the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.

When those two offramps were ignored, Democrats in the House moved quickly toward impeachment and the first post-presidential impeachment trial in US history.

Impeaching Trump in the House requires only a simple majority and Democrats hope to gain at least some support from Republicans.

What does the Constitution say about the Senate's role?"
2157	"Unusually Cold Weather in Texas Seeks a Chance to Change Up the Energy Situation.

The Texas winter has been quite cold, with temperatures in Texas between 10,000 and 13,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This means that electricity prices in Texas have skyrocketed over the last few weeks, resulting in a significant disruption to the state's energy facilities. In addition, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas have been affected, leading to higher energy prices, while renewable energy sources like solar and wind have been reduced. As a result, the state's energy production has been severely disrupted.

As a CNN journalist, I would like to emphasize the importance of understanding the Arctic climate firsthand. Our planet is constantly changing, and the effects of temperatures on our environment are far-reaching, impacting our entire lifespans. Our Arctic ecosystems are essential for maintaining global temperatures, which are approximately 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer than normal. In addition, the melting ice caps and polar regions around the world are melting at an alarming rate, making it difficult for species to adapt to changing conditions. To address this issue, we need to prioritize sustainable energy sources, as well as the conservation of natural resources, such as Arctic wildlife and ecosystems."
412	"Will those who yell the loudest teach kids how the world really works?

We teach our children lessons about leading with empathy and intelligence, about taking the high road, about playing fair. And we warn them that bullies never win in the end. Be the bigger person. Follow the right and righteous path, and you shall be rewarded.

But the examples being set on very public stages tell an entirely different story, one that says accumulating power is the goal, with no guardrails on how you acquire and keep it. Rules are for suckers, unless you're the one who makes them.

Take voting rights. If the goal of our democracy is to let all eligible Americans vote and for every one of those votes to count, the Freedom to Vote Act would have had a clear glide path to passage. But when, as promised by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the compromise bill massaged by holdout West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin was brought to the floor Wednesday, not for a vote but for a mere discussion, Republicans offered no help.

How far Democrats will go to pass rules that creep toward restoring parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, obliterated by the Supreme Court, is uncertain. But for anyone interested in a true representative form of government in the United States, something is needed.

Power play

That's not the view of Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who understands the ruthless power game without regard to the example it sets for the next generations. From Washington, his party sees advantage in election antics in states such as Texas, where GOP-heavy leadership is greedily grabbing the two House seats delivered by an increasing and increasingly diverse electorate with one hand, and gerrymandering away minority representation with the other.

After protests, the Republicans who control the Texas Legislature and the redistricting process have restored to Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's new district many of the Black Houston residents she currently represents. But every battle for every vote will be a tough one. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, who represents the San Antonio area, said the new map was ""designed to discriminate, particularly against Latinos, who are the driving force behind the state's population growth.""

As the census counts a U.S. population growing less white, it's an existential threat to those who see resources and representation as zero-sum. Unwilling to share leadership with people who were once locked out by law, states are changing the rules of democracy, and that is not a game.

Texas is not the outlier, but the leader on this kind of obstinance, passing laws to loosen gun rules and unleash poll watchers on any voter deemed suspicious, turning them into the bullies (perhaps armed) that we warn our children about. It's no longer ""Love thy neighbors,"" but snitch on them for bounty if we think they're even thinking about getting an abortion. Those new laws won't, of course, end abortion for those with the means to travel to another state; it will just drive desperate girls and women to seek desperate solutions.

Texas is just one place where you can find adults yelling at and sometimes threatening schoolteachers and administrators over what is not critical race theory (and I defy any of the objectors to come up with a coherent definition). It seems what they really fear are lessons that tell the truth about America, a country with lofty promises it has not always lived up to. If history includes racial truths that lead to understanding and progress, these folks want none of it."
272	"QAnon Shaman's Lawyer Offers Jacob Chansley as Witness in Trump's Impeachment Trial: 'Betrayed' Chansley Claims He Was Incited by Trump

Jacob Chansley, the man infamously known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" for his distinctive appearance during the Capitol riot, is now offering himself as a witness in former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Chansley's attorney, Albert Watkins, made the announcement on Thursday.

Albert Watkins, Chansley's lawyer: ""Mr. Chansley is prepared to testify truthfully about his actions on January 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol, including but not limited to, his presence at the Capitol, his interactions with law enforcement, and his conversations with others regarding the events of that day.""

Chansley, who was dressed in face paint, no shirt, and a fur hat adorned with horns during the insurrection, has become a recognizable figure in the aftermath of the violent events that transpired on January 6, 2021. He is a self-proclaimed leader in the QAnon conspiracy theory movement.

Despite his willingness to testify, Chansley, who faces multiple charges, including civil disorder and obstruction, feels betrayed by Trump after not receiving a pardon for his actions during the insurrection. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Chansley expressed his disappointment: ""I thought he'd come through for us.""

Chansley and other rioters claim they were incited by Trump to participate in the riot. In his statement to the FBI, Chansley admitted his role in the events: ""I came to D.C. at the request of the 45th President of the United States."" However, prosecutors argue that Chansley led a group into the Senate chamber and left a threatening note for Vice President Mike Pence, which read, ""It's Only A Matter Of Time, Justice Is Coming.""

Watkins maintains that Chansley did not intend to threaten anyone: ""Mr. Chansley's intent was not to threaten Vice President Pence, nor was it to incite or encourage violence. Instead, Mr. Chansley intended to engage peacefully with his fellow Americans and to express his grievances regarding the election results.""

Chansley called the FBI to admit his involvement in the riot on January 16, 2021. During the call, Chansley referred to Pence as a ""child-trafficking traitor,"" reflecting the baseless conspiracy theories that have fueled the actions of some rioters.

The arraignment for Chansley and other rioters is scheduled for February 16, 2021, in Washington, D.C. If convicted, Chansley could face up to 20 years in prison.

As the impeachment trial proceeds, Chansley's testimony could potentially shed light on the motivations and actions of those who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021. However, it remains to be seen how much impact his testimony will have on the outcome of the trial."
1304	"US Capitol riot: FBI Director Wray knocks down conspiracy theory that January 6 rioters were 'fake Trump protesters'

Washington CNN — FBI Director Chris Wray told lawmakers Tuesday that the FBI has not seen any evidence indicating that the rioters who took part in the January 6 US Capitol attack were ""fake Trump protesters,"" knocking down a baseless claim that has been pushed by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in recent weeks as he has sought to downplay the violence committed by supporters of former President Donald Trump.

Testifying publicly for the first time since pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol nearly two months ago, Wray was pressed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin on whether the FBI has seen any evidence that individuals involved in the January 6 attack were posing as Trump supporters – a claim the Illinois Democrat called ""the next big lie.""

""We have not seen evidence of that, at this stage, certainly,"" Wray responded when Durbin asked if he had seen any evidence the riot was organized by ""fake Trump protesters,"" referring to comments Johnson made during a Senate hearing last week in which he also claimed those involved in the attack were ""agents provocateurs.""

Most Republicans on the panel did not embrace these conspiracies, but the baseless claim that left-wing infiltrators were responsible for the violent attack has been promoted by Trump's impeachment lawyers, several GOP lawmakers and at least one speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week.

On Tuesday, Wray made clear that Antifa and other left-wing groups were not part of the violence on January 6, which he called ""domestic terrorism"" – even as several Republicans sought to use the hearing as an opportunity to highlight the threat posed by those groups rather than focus on the Capitol attack.

""We have not, to date, seen any evidence of anarchist violent extremists or people subscribing to Antifa in connection to the 6th,"" Wray told the Senate committee.

More than 260 defendants – many of them professing allegiance to Trump, disgust for Congress, and supportive of revolution – have been charged in federal court related to their actions in and around the US Capitol siege on January 6.

Previously, nearly a dozen Trump supporters charged in connection with the US Capitol insurrection have said that Antifa and other left-wing groups weren't involved in the attack, further debunking the conspiracy among Trump supporters.

Additionally, Wray testified Tuesday that the FBI is ""not aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud that would have affected the outcome in the election,"" undercutting a false narrative that was repeatedly pushed by Trump and his allies during the 2020 campaign.

Many Republicans on Capitol Hill have continued to push unfounded accusations of widespread election fraud, which Trump critics have taken to calling ""the Big Lie,"" in the weeks since the January 6 attack despite evidence that such claims helped fuel the deadly riot and warnings they continue to motivate domestic extremists.

Wray dodges opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon

While Wray spent much of Tuesday's hearing dispelling dangerous false claims, he dodged an opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse the QAnon conspiracy theories.

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he was ""disappointed"" Wray sidestepped an opportunity to condemn elected officials who have amplified the QAnon claims when asked if they are contributing to the threat of domestic extremism by doing so.

""Well, certainly we are concerned about the QAnon phenomenon which we view as a sort of loose, sort of set of conspiracy theories, and we've certainly seen domestic violent extremists of the sort that you're describing, who cite that as part of their motivation. And so that's something that we do,"" Wray said.

Blumenthal interrupted Wray for not immediately condemning the idea that lawmakers support the insurrectionists and asked the question in another way: ""When members of Congress, as has happened endorse the QAnon theory, doesn't it worsen the threat of violence?""

But Wray still did not take the opportunity to denounce the behavior, prompting Blumenthal to make clear he was disappointed by the response and intends to follow up on the issue in another setting.

In October, CNN reported that several congressional candidates engaged with the QAnon conspiracy theory of those mentioned, Marjorie Taylor Greene went on to win a seat in Georgia's 14th Congressional District.

Wray pressed on 'Norfolk memo'

Wray's team of federal investigators is currently chasing thousands of leads in twin efforts to prosecute people involved in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and to try to prevent feared follow-up attacks in Washington and around the country."

306	"Beyond Convictions: The Urgent Call for Police Abolition

The guilty verdict in Derek Chauvin's trial for the murder of George Floyd has been hailed by many as a significant step towards justice. Yet, as former President Barack Obama and President Joe Biden have pointed out, while the verdict may represent accountability, it falls short of true justice. This distinction underscores a profound and uncomfortable truth: the current system of policing in the United States, steeped in racial and economic control, cannot be rectified merely through reforms or isolated convictions.

The belief that police reforms can resolve the deep-seated racial bias within policing is fundamentally flawed. Policing, as it stands, is an apparatus of racial and economic suppression – a reality that cannot be erased by body cameras, diversity training, or community policing initiatives. Even in a hypothetical scenario where racial bias is completely eradicated from policing, the system would still fail to address the root issues of inequality and exploitation that plague society. The problems we face require solutions that transcend the scope of policing, demanding a fundamental reimagining of public safety and community support.

The remarkably low rate of police officers being convicted for killing civilians – despite the thousands of lives lost at the hands of law enforcement – only serves to underscore the inadequacy of relying on the court system to prevent future tragedies. Celebrating Chauvin's conviction as a moment of justice ignores the broader context in which law enforcement operates with extensive freedom to employ force, often with deadly consequences. This grim reality was highlighted tragically on the very day of Chauvin's verdict, as a white police officer in Columbus, Ohio, fatally shot 15-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant, a Black girl.

This incident, alongside the numerous killings by police during the Chauvin trial itself, starkly illustrates the ongoing epidemic of police violence and the elusive nature of justice for its victims. These cases, each a devastating loss of life, remind us that convictions, while providing a semblance of relief for the living, do not save lives. They prompt us to question the very definitions of accountability and justice in the context of a system fundamentally designed to oppress. It is increasingly evident that meaningful change – the kind that could prevent further loss of life and truly ensure public safety – requires a complete abolition of the current policing model.

It is high time we cast aside incremental reforms in favor of embracing the radical yet necessary call for police abolition. This does not signify an absence of public safety measures, but rather a call for a profound transformation of how safety is defined and achieved, involving investment in education, healthcare, housing, and other social services that address the underlying causes of harm in our communities. To this end, we must amplify and support the social movements and organizations tirelessly working towards such transformational change. The path to genuine justice and accountability is long and fraught with challenges, but it is a journey we must undertake. For it is only through abolishing an inherently oppressive system and building from its ashes a society rooted in care, equity, and mutual aid, that we can hope to honor the memory of George Floyd and countless others whose lives have been cut short by police violence."
227	"Trash Parade Draws Attention to New Orleans Garbage Crisis Post-Hurricane Ida

Residents of New Orleans are grappling with a growing garbage crisis as piles of uncollected trash line the streets for weeks after Hurricane Ida wreaked havoc on the city. Residents, who have been dealing with the issue since before the hurricane struck on August 29, voiced their frustrations to a City Council committee.

Among those frustrated residents is Aaron ""Louisiana"" Grant, who proposed a unique solution to draw attention to the ongoing garbage collection problems – a Trash Parade. Grant took to Facebook with his idea, which was intended as a satirical protest to highlight the city's failed sanitation services. The event quickly gained traction, with over 1,900 interested participants showing support for the initiative.

Approximately 150 protesters, embracing creativity and ingenuity, came together to participate in the Trash Parade. Donning imaginative costumes and wielding clever signs, the demonstrators marched through the streets, aiming to bring awareness to the dire situation the city is facing post-Ida. Grant, the brains behind the inventive protest, sees humor as a coping mechanism for residents trying to navigate the challenges in the aftermath of the disaster.

Despite the attention garnered by the Trash Parade, the garbage collection issues persist in New Orleans, with trash remaining visible throughout the city. Mayor LaToya Cantrell acknowledged the severity of the situation, attributing the ongoing problems to a workforce shortage that has been exacerbated by the impact of Hurricane Ida. In response to the crisis, the city is actively seeking assistance from outside contractors to address the sanitation challenges plaguing New Orleans.

Aaron Grant, in his criticism of the local government's handling of the sanitation crisis, points to a lack of proper planning and preparation for such emergencies. Grant highlights the discrepancy between the swift assistance received by other sectors, such as electrical and healthcare services, in the aftermath of Ida, and the lack of support provided to the vital sanitation services that are crucial for the city's well-being.

Grant, emphasizing the need for urgent action to resolve the garbage crisis, calls on local authorities to prioritize this essential service that directly impacts the health and quality of life of New Orleans residents. As the city continues to grapple with the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, the Trash Parade stands as a vivid reminder of the pressing need for immediate and effective solutions to address the mounting garbage woes in the city."
1510	"How Shippers Will Have to Pay for the Suez Canal Blockage

The grounding of the Evergreen Line containership Ever Given in the Suez Canal in March created a massive legal and insurance dispute that could take months, if not years, to resolve. In this conversation with SupplyChainBrain Editor-in-Chief Bob Bowman, Joe Klobus, claims and insurance manager with global freight forwarder OEC Group, discusses how the incident brought to light the concept of general average, a centuries-old law that requires shippers to share the losses from such an event.

SCB: What is general average?

Klobus: In short, it's the equitable sharing of a loss between the vessel owners and cargo interests. When the vessel encounters a peril that fits within the York Antwerp Rules, the vessel owners are able to declare general average, which would spread that loss across the cargo interests.

SCB: In what kind of situations has this previously been invoked?

Klobus: General average is often invoked for vessel fires or containers going overboard as a sacrifice. However, it's not commonly known that it doesn't apply to just that limited scope of events. It can also apply to salvage, to towing expenses, and for seeking refuge in a port or harbor. It's much broader than people typically know.

SCB: So in a hypothetical situation where the carrier is found to be at fault, it couldn't invoke general average?

Klobus: That's not true. If the carrier is at fault for a situation and it fits within the realm of the York Antwerp Rules, it can declare general average. And, generally speaking, the carriers aren't responsible when they do declare general average. Of course, this can lead to lengthy litigation, but the law generally supports their stance.

SCB: Is Evergreen invoking it in the Suez incident?

Klobus: It's actually the owners of the vessel who invoked general average — Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd."
891	"Gabby Petito Disappearance: Witnesses Describe Argument at Jackson Hole Restaurant

JACKSON, Wyo. – The disappearance of Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old woman from Florida, has sparked a massive investigation and search efforts across several states. Petito was last seen in a restaurant in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, had an argument with the staff.

According to witnesses Nina Celie Angelo and Matthew England, who were in town for a wedding, Laundrie's behavior was described as ""aggressive"" and involved a dispute over the bill or money. Petito apologized for Laundrie's behavior during the incident, which occurred on August 27.

""I was sitting at the bar, and I heard a commotion coming from the back of the restaurant,"" Angelo said in an interview with FOX 13 News. ""I turned around, and I saw Brian Laundrie yelling at the staff. He was being really aggressive and demanding. Gabby was trying to calm him down, but he wasn't having it.""

England, who was also at the restaurant, described Laundrie's behavior as ""erratic"" and said that Petito appeared ""visibly upset.""

""I could tell that Gabby was uncomfortable and trying to defuse the situation,"" England said. ""She apologized to the staff and tried to calm Brian down, but he just wouldn't listen.""

The incident at the Merry Piglets Tex-Mex restaurant occurred just two days after Petito's final Instagram post and weeks after a domestic fight between the couple was reported in Utah.

Bodycam footage from a Moab, Utah police response matches the observed behavior of Petito and Laundrie. The couple was recognized from their behavior at the restaurant and from the police bodycam footage.

Gabby Petito's disappearance followed soon after the restaurant incident, with her remains found later in a campsite north of Jackson Hole. Brian Laundrie returned home to Florida without Petito on September 1 and retained a lawyer. He has refused to speak with police.

North Port police spokesperson Josh Taylor confirmed that the department is investigating Laundrie's behavior at the restaurant and its potential connection to Petito's disappearance.

""We are aware of the incident at the restaurant and are looking into it as part of our investigation,"" Taylor said. ""We are also working with law enforcement in Wyoming to gather more information and piece together the timeline of events leading up to Gabby's disappearance.""

The search for Petito has now expanded to several states, including Wyoming, Utah, and Florida. The FBI has also joined the investigation.

""We are doing everything we can to find Gabby and bring her home safely,"" Taylor said. ""We urge anyone with information about her disappearance to come forward and contact us immediately.""

As the investigation continues, the public is asked to remain vigilant and report any sightings of Petito or Laundrie to the authorities.

""We appreciate the public's help in spreading the word and bringing attention to this case,"" Taylor said. ""We will continue to work tirelessly until we find Gabby and bring her home to her family.""

Anyone with information about Petito's disappearance is urged to contact the North Port Police Department at (941) 429-7300 or the FBI's tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324)."
1219	"Vanderbilt's Sarah Fuller to Take Part in Biden's Inauguration Event: 'Time to #LeadLikeAWoman'

Add Vanderbilt kicker Sarah Fuller to the list of stars set to make an appearance in a primetime special airing Wednesday in honor of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.

Organizers say the ""Celebrating America"" primetime special, which will air across most of the major broadcast and cable news networks, will ""celebrate the beginning of a new national journey toward an America united.""

A host of celebrities are set to appear in the Tom Hanks-hosted special, including Foo Fighters, John Legend, Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington and Bruce Springsteen.

In addition to musical performances — which will be filmed in ""iconic locations across the country,"" according to a press release from the transition team — Longoria and Washington are set to introduce segments throughout the night from stories of young people making a difference in their communities.

The special is set to air Wednesday night after Biden's swearing-in at the U.S. Capitol.

Fuller shared the news of her participation in the inauguration special on Twitter, writing: ""It's an honor to be invited to participate in one of America's greatest traditions. This historic inauguration is especially meaningful for American women and girls. The glass ceilings are breaking and it is the time to #LeadLikeAWoman.""

Fuller tagged Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and the Biden-Harris presidential transition in her post, which also featured photos in which she could be seen recording her appearance at Vanderbilt Stadium.

In December, Fuller became the first woman to score in a Power 5 football game when she kicked an extra point in the first quarter of the team's game against Tennessee.

Fuller, a senior, also played on the university's women's soccer team last fall, and led the team to an SEC championship in 2020, before walking on to the football team.

In November, she became the first woman to play in a Power 5 regular-season college football game, making her debut during the second half of a game against Missouri.

Speaking to ESPN, Fuller spoke about the magnitude of her history-making appearance in the game: ""All I want to do is be a good influence to the young girls out there because there were times I struggled in sports, but I'm so thankful that I stuck with it and it's given me so many opportunities and I've met so many amazing people through sports.""

""Celebrating America"" will air Wednesday (8:30 p.m. ET) on ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and NBC as well as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and other streaming platforms."
1884	"Virginia State Senator Amanda Chase Suspended from Facebook for Inciting Violence

Facebook has suspended the official account of Virginia state Sen. Amanda F. Chase for seven days and restricted live video for 60 days after she praised rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol as ""patriots"" and suggested without evidence that left-wing involvement occurred. This move comes as part of a broader crackdown on social media accounts inciting violence, including President Trump's suspension from Twitter and Facebook.

Chase, a self-described ""Trump in heels,"" has been a controversial figure within her party due to her inflammatory rhetoric. In recent months, she has called for President Trump to declare martial law to prevent his removal from office and has been a vocal supporter of the president.

The suspension of Chase's account follows a flagging of several of her posts as ""False information"" by Facebook, including claims about antifa infiltration among Trump supporters. The Virginia State Senate's Democratic Caucus has called for Chase's resignation, accusing her of empowering a failed coup d'etat.

Chase has dismissed criticism from Virginia Democrats and accused them of ""committing treason"" by easing voting restrictions. The Senate Republican Caucus, which Chase left in 2019, has declined to comment on the situation.

Despite the backlash, Chase has shown no signs of backing down from her inflammatory rhetoric. In a recent interview, she stated, ""I will not be silenced by the liberal left. I will continue to speak the truth and stand up for President Trump, no matter the cost.""

Chase's suspension from Facebook has sparked a heated debate among Virginians, with some defending her right to free speech and others calling for her resignation. The incident has also raised concerns about the role of social media in shaping political discourse and the need for greater regulation of online platforms.

In conclusion, the suspension of Amanda Chase's Facebook account is a clear example of the consequences of inciting violence and spreading false information on social media. While Chase's right to free speech is protected under the First Amendment, the use of social media to incite violence and undermine democratic institutions is a serious issue that must be addressed. As social media platforms continue to play a growing role in shaping political discourse, it is essential that they take responsibility for the content they host and the impact it has on society."
42	"White House Discord: Harris and Aides at Odds Amid Frustrations and Concerns

CNN – The West Wing is reportedly grappling with tensions between Vice President Kamala Harris and her staff, with key aides expressing frustration over perceived obstacles to addressing pressing issues. The situation has raised concerns about Harris's preparation, positioning, and potential future roles within the Biden administration.

According to sources familiar with the matter, Harris and her circle feel sidelined and believe she is not being adequately prepared or positioned for success. This sentiment has created a sense of urgency among some aides, who feel there is no time to address these concerns amidst other legislative and political priorities.

The vice president's supporters are particularly concerned about her public perception and lack of substantive work, fearing that these factors could jeopardize her political future. Some even speculate that President Biden might consider replacing her if her performance does not improve.

The scrutiny Harris faces is amplified by her historic position as the first woman and woman of color to serve as vice president. Insiders believe she is not being well-prepared for the role, which requires her to navigate complex political dynamics and manage a diverse portfolio of responsibilities.

Eleni Kounalakis, the Lieutenant Governor of California and a longtime friend of Harris, expressed concern about the vice president's situation. ""Kamala is a brilliant and capable leader, but she's facing unprecedented challenges as the first woman and woman of color in her position,"" Kounalakis said. ""She deserves our full support and the resources she needs to succeed.""

Minyon Moore, a longtime Democratic operative and important outside adviser to Harris, echoed these sentiments. ""Kamala is a trailblazer who has broken down barriers throughout her career,"" Moore said. ""We should be doing everything we can to ensure she has the tools and support she needs to be successful.""

Speculation is growing among Democrats about Harris's position and potential primary challenges due to perceived weaknesses. Some believe she lacks the necessary experience and political acumen to effectively lead the country, while others worry that her cautious approach and staff issues could hinder her ability to connect with voters.

Harris has less Washington experience than President Biden, which has complicated her adjustment to the vice presidency. She has also faced criticism for her handling of certain issues, such as the border crisis and the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Underlying issues of racism and sexism are also seen as factors affecting Harris's public perception and responsibilities. Some believe she is held to a higher standard than her male counterparts and that her accomplishments are often overlooked or diminished.

Sources claim that Harris's staff has often failed her, with some describing a lack of coordination and strategic planning. Her cautious approach and staff issues have been longstanding traits, according to those familiar with her career.

Despite efforts to integrate Harris into significant roles within the administration, there are concerns that she is not fully utilized. Some believe she could be playing a more prominent role in policy development and public engagement.

The situation has created a sense of uncertainty and frustration among Harris's supporters, who believe she has the potential to be a transformative leader but needs the necessary support and resources to succeed.

As the Biden administration navigates a challenging political landscape, the vice president's role and performance will continue to be under intense scrutiny. The coming months will be critical in determining Harris's future and her ability to overcome the obstacles she faces."
1345	"Why Two Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine for Pfizer and Moderna?

COVID-19 is the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. While many people with COVID-19 get mild symptoms, others can become seriously ill. Several vaccines have been developed to protect against COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. Two of these are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Both of these vaccines require two doses. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has also been authorized for emergency use. However, this vaccine only requires one dose. Why do some vaccines require two doses? How long do you need to wait between doses? Do you have any immunity after the first dose? This article will help explain why you need two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and will provide answers to many other questions, too.

How do these vaccines work? The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both use mRNA technology. The cells in your body naturally use mRNA all the time to create many different types of proteins that you need to stay healthy. The mRNA in the two-dose COVID-19 vaccines provide the cells of your body with instructions on how to make the spike protein that's specific to the new coronavirus. This spike protein is found on the surface of the virus. It uses this spike protein to attach to and enter a host cell in your body. When you get your COVID-19 vaccine, your immune system processes information on the spike protein and generates an immune response to it. This includes the production of antibodies. Vaccines hinge on a very important aspect of your immune system, which is the fact that it has memory. After your vaccination, your immune system continues to store information on the spike protein. If you're exposed to the new coronavirus, your immune system will then use this stored information to respond and protect you from the virus. This can help prevent you from becoming sick with COVID-19. The entire immunity process typically takes around 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. That's why you can still contract the new coronavirus and become ill if you're exposed to it shortly after getting your vaccine."
1250	"Kyle Rittenhouse says he's not racist and he backs BLM

New York — Kyle Rittenhouse, who was found not guilty of charges stemming from killing two men and wounding another during the unrest that followed the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer, says in a new interview that he's ""not a racist person"" and supports the Black Lives Matter movement.

""This case has nothing to do with race. It never had anything to do with race. It had to do with the right to self-defense,"" the 18-year-old tells Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview set to air Monday night. Rittenhouse is white, as were the men he shot.

""I'm not a racist person. I support the BLM movement, I support peacefully demonstrating,"" Rittenhouse tells Carlson in excerpts of the interview released by Fox News ahead of its airing.

""The jury reached the correct verdict -- self-defense is not illegal,"" Rittenhouse said, according to Agence France-Presse. ""I'm glad that everything went well. ... We made it through the hard part.""

A spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, David Hancock, told CBS Milwaukee affiliate WDJT-TV Rittenhouse is ready to move on and be a free 18-year-old man.

Hancock said Rittenhouse was ""dragged through the mud"" with lies this past year, adding that he's a caring, empathetic and civic-minded young man.

""He's got some things to say and I think ... you're going to be even more surprised by who Kyle actually is, (the) more people get to know him better,"" Hancock said.

Kyle Rittenhouse reacts after the jury found him not guilty on all charges for the shootings at a 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on November 19, 2021. Pool/CBS News

Rittenhouse was 17 last year when he traveled 20 miles from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, which had been racked with protests in the wake of the Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake. That shooting and the response in Kenosha - protests that turned destructive - became part of the national reckoning over police use of force against Black people following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis the previous May at the hands of police.

Rittenhouse, armed with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle, joined others who said they were intent on protecting private property from potential damage on Aug. 25. During his trial, prosecutors argued that the teenager was a ""wannabe soldier"" who went looking for trouble that night. Rittenhouse countered that he fired in self-defense after he was attacked and was in fear for his life.

The shootings quickly made Rittenhouse a rallying cry for supporters of Second Amendment rights and those angered by the sometimes violent protests seen in some American cities after Floyd's death."
686	"Social Security Recipients Are Finally Getting Their Third Stimulus Check

Millions of seniors who didn't file a 2019 or 2020 tax return have already started receiving their third stimulus checks. After receiving data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in late March, the IRS was able to start processing third stimulus payments for approximately 30 million seniors. These people will generally get their stimulus payment in the same way they get their regular Social Security benefits. Since most of these payments will be paid electronically through direct deposits or to existing Direct Express debit cards, the funds have already been delivered to many of these seniors. For those still waiting, more payments will arrive this week and in the following weeks.

Third stimulus payments are generally based on information found on your 2019 or 2020 tax return. That's why many people who receive Social Security benefits and filed a 2019 or 2020 return, or who used the IRS's Non-Filers tool last year, received a third stimulus check in March. However, since some Social Security recipients don't file tax returns, the IRS didn't have the necessary information in its computer systems to process third-round stimulus payments for them. That's why the tax agency needed data from the SSA to send out checks to seniors who haven't file a recent tax return.

In addition to seniors receiving Social Security retirement benefits, payments are also being sent to people receiving Social Security disability (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits who didn't file a 2019 or 2020 tax return or didn't use the Non-Filers tool. Veterans who receive benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs but didn't file a recent tax return should start getting third-round stimulus payments soon, too.

Most Social Security, SSDI, SSI, and RRB beneficiaries who are eligible for a third stimulus check don't need to take any action to receive a payment (not everyone is eligible). However, as with previous stimulus payments, some beneficiaries may need to file a 2020 tax return – even if they don't usually file – to provide the IRS the information it needs to send an additional $1,400 for a spouse or any dependents. The deadline for filing a 2020 tax return has been pushed back from April 15 to May 17, 2021.

Amount of Your Third Stimulus Check

Every eligible American will receive a $1,400 third stimulus check ""base amount."" The base amount jumps to $2,800 for married couples filing a joint tax return. You also get an extra $1,400 for each dependent in your family (regardless of the dependent's age)."
1493	"Security door locks installed 4 years ago at Michigan high school may have saved lives

A decision four years ago to install special lockdown locks on classroom doors at Oxford High School likely saved lives during the shooting spree last week.

The locks, specifically made for classrooms by a company in Mt. Morris, Mich., that has sold door locks to 300 school districts in Michigan and about 10,000 districts across the country.

""It's not a lock until it needs to be, it's a piece of hardware that mounts to the door and another piece that mounts to the floor. The locking device is a red handle that lives in a wallbox on the wall beside the door,'' said Cris Ahearn, director of sales for Nightlock.

In the event of a lockdown or a drill, the box is opened, the red handle removed. One end is slid into a slot into the door; the other end fits into a notch in a metal plate mounted on the floor.

""If a classroom door has glass ... and the perpetrator tries to break the glass and reach in and turn the handle to gain entry into the room, they can't do that because the door is locked at the floor,'' Ahearn said.

Oxford started installing the locks in 2017, according to Nightlock records. One version installed works on doors that swing outward or inward. Another version works on outward swinging doors which most classroom doors are. Oxford had a mix of both locks at the high school and districtwide.

The locks average about $50 per door.

The alleged shooter never entered a classroom during the shooting spree that killed four students and wounded six more students and a teacher on Tuesday, Nov. 30.

Those killed and wounded were fired upon in the hallways.

""The first thing I thought of was at least they have our locks. Then we're watching it unfold at our computers and at first they were saying no loss of life and we were relieved. Then we found out that was not the case,'' Ahearn said. ""For the whole emotional week we've gone through I keep thinking about how do you lock down the hallways? We can provide safe rooms in every office and every classroom, but if you're in the hallway, then you're exposed and it's tragic.''

Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard reviewed the crime scene last week and credited Oxford Community Schools with taking safety precautions.

""There is an extensive camera system thanks to the proactive work of Oxford schools. ... Our liaison taught them ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate),'' Bouchard said. ""Desks were upturned, doors were barricaded, doors were actually hit by gunfire and so were barricades. But the doors were safe, so that behavior, that training, those protocols saved lives.''

On Friday and Monday, the phone were ringing at Nightlock's offices.

""It's not the reason you want the phone to ring, our hearts are broken and devastated. I have friends who have kids that go to that school. It's tragic,'' Ahearn said.

""A lot of districts are trying to harden their facilities,'' Ahearn said.

Nightlock started making residential locks to prevent home invasions after the owners' parents home was broken into while their mom was there. They came up with a residential lock as a hobby and sold it on the internet. They ran their father's steel company full-time.

Then came the 26 deaths in 2021— including 20 children — at Sandy Hook Elementary, in Newtown, Conn.

""After Sandy Hook, teachers started calling, they wanted these devices for their classrooms but that (residential) device doesn't meet code as far classroom for egress,'' Ahearn said. ""So the lockdown device was designed based on a collaboration with school administrators and code officials to come up with something that is safe and effective. We've been doing that since 2012, since Sandy Hook.""

She said in the past week they've received an outpouring of emails and social media posts from parents and children thanking them that the school had the locks."
1061	"San Francisco braces for pro-Trump rally at Twitter headquarters

Days after social media giant Twitter banned President Trump from its platform in the wake of the violent takeover of the U.S. Capitol, San Francisco police were bracing for a demonstration by his supporters Monday at the company's headquarters.

While there's been no official word about a mass demonstration, there's been social media traffic urging supporters of the president to gather at Twitter headquarters.

The thousands of Twitter employees who would normally be at work Monday haven't been in the building since March 2020 when they were told to work remotely because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

In a statement to the San Francisco Chronicle Sunday night, a company spokesman said Twitter respects ""people's right to express their views.""

""While we respect people's right to express their views, we've been transparent about the factors leading up to our decision last week,"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""We have nothing to add but wanted to confirm that we continue to have mandatory work from home guidance for Twitter employees.""

San Francisco police told the newspaper they had plans in place — including the calling in of mutual aid from nearby law enforcement agencies — if needed.

Twitter announced Friday afternoon it had permanently suspended Mr. Trump's account over concerns his tweets could incite violence.

In a statement, the company said Twitter officials had reviewed Mr. Trump's tweets from the past week and determined they violated the site's policies.

The suspension came just days after Trump supporters took over the U.S. Capitol by force, resulting in the deaths of five people as Congress began to certify Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election win.

""In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,"" Twitter wrote at the time. ""Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open.""

""However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things.""

The statement includes Twitter's documentation of Trump tweets the company said violated its ""glorification of violence"" standards.

Twitter wasn't alone in taking action against the President. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Youtube also suspended Trump accounts and Amazon, Apple and Google have all booted pro-Trump Parler off their platforms."
1876	"2 trials, 1 theme: White men taking law into their own hands

The trials of Kyle Rittenhouse and three men accused of killing Ahmaud Arbery had vastly different outcomes. But coming just days apart, they laid bare a dangerous and long-running current in the fight for racial equality: The move by some white Americans to grab guns and take their own stand against perceptions of lawlessness, particularly by Black people.

The two cases, which ended with an acquittal for Rittenhouse last week and guilty verdicts for Arbery's killers on Wednesday, highlighted polarizing issues about gun and self-defense laws, and racial injustice.

They also forced the questions: Who or what is being protected? And from whom? Should peace of mind for white Americans come at the expense of the protection and safety of Black Americans?

""So much of this issue about protection and safety is about the safety and the protection of whites or white property,"" said Carol Anderson, historian and professor of African American studies at Emory University. ""There is a hubris of whiteness. The sense that it is on me to put Black lives back into their proper place.""

Arbery, a Black man, was chased and shot to death by white men suspicious of an outsider in their predominantly white Georgia neighborhood. In Wisconsin, while both Rittenhouse and the three men he shot were white, the encounter was triggered by the 17-year-old's decision to travel from his Illinois home to Kenosha and arm himself with an AR-15 rifle, bent on protecting local businesses from Black Lives Matter protesters.

The unmistakable connection: The idea that white men who perceive a problem ""should grab a gun and wade into trouble and then claim self-defense,"" said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.

""This is a product of a gun culture. It's also a product of laws ... that give white men with guns the ability to create chaos and sometimes get away with it,"" said Waldman, author of ""The Second Amendment: A Biography.""

The two coinciding trials highlighted deep racial rifts within American society, particularly following last year's broad movement for racial justice that swept the country in the wake of George Floyd's murder.

Both also came at the end of a year that began with an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, in which an overwhelmingly white crowd of supporters of former President Donald Trump, enraged with the idea that the 2020 election was ""stolen"" from them, stormed the building in an effort to take ownership of the government.

The impetus for raiding the Capitol, Anderson said, was the unfounded claim that there was massive amounts of voter fraud in cities where there were sizable Black populations, ""the notion that Black folks voting is what stole the election.""

""That's the thing about vigilantism, it's that something precious to me, for me, for my community, is being stolen and it's being stolen by the unworthy, by the undeserving,"" Anderson said.

White vigilantism signifies ""the need to keep the Black population, particularly the Black male population, under surveillance and under control,"" said writer Darryl Pinckney. It has evolved over time, but there is a long history in the U.S. of people taking the law into their own hands — and of white Americans using that as a pretext to violently enforce racial boundaries."
1038	"Twitter bans Trump, citing risk of violent incitement

Twitter banned President Donald Trump's account Friday, citing ""the risk of further incitement of violence"" following the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.

Twitter has long given Trump and other world leaders broad exemptions from its rules against personal attacks, hate speech and other behaviors. But in a detailed explanation posted on its blog Friday, the company said recent Trump tweets amounted to glorification of violence when read in the context of the Capitol riot and plans circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.

The social platform has been under growing pressure to take further action against Trump following the Wednesday violence. On Thursday, Facebook suspended Trump's account through Jan. 20 and possibly indefinitely. Twitter merely suspended Trump's account for 12 hours after he posted a video that repeated false claims about election fraud and praised the rioters who stormed the Capitol.

Trump's Twitter persona has long functioned as a mix of policy announcements, often out of the blue; complaints about the media; disparagement of women, minorities and his perceived enemies; and praise for his supporters, replete with exclamation marks, all-caps, and one-word declarations such as ""Sad!""

He has fired numerous officials on Twitter and his posts, like his speeches at rallies, are a torrent of misinformation.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to make CEO Jack Dorsey available and had no further comment.

The official account for the President of the United States, @POTUS, remains live. In fact, Trump, who issued a statement Friday evening that denounced Twitter as an enemy of free speech and floated the idea that he might build his own ""platform,"" also posted it on the @POTUS account, where it was quickly deleted.

Twitter says using another account to evade a suspension is against its rules, and that while it won't ban government accounts like @POTUS or @WhiteHouse, it will ""take action to limit their use.""

Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, said the move lets Twitter try to curry favor with the incoming Biden administration. Trump ""only has two weeks left in power, and that certainly makes it easier to deplatform the president,"" she said.

Others saw a more ominous portent in Twitter's action. ""Big Tech is not going to stop with the president of the United States,"" Kay James, president of the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a tweet. ""They can ban you next and everyone reading this.""

In the Trump tweets cited by Twitter, Trump stated that he will not be attending the inauguration and referred to his supporters as ""American Patriots,"" saying they will have ""a GIANT VOICE long into the future."" Twitter said these statements ""are likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.""

Twitter said its policy enables world leaders to speak to the public, but that these accounts ""are not above our rules entirely"" and can't use Twitter to incite violence. Trump had roughly 89 million followers. Twitter shares fell roughly 4% in after-hours trading, reflecting concerns that the Trump ban might reduce usage and advertising sales.

Jonathan Greenblatt, who heads the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday that banning Trump was an ""excellent step"" and ""a fitting end to a legacy of spewing hate and vitriol."" The ADL was part of a coalition of civil rights and advocacy groups on Friday calling for Twitter to ban Trump's account.

Twitter, long accused of treating the president with kid gloves, began policing Trump more aggressively starting in the early days of the general presidential campaign, when the company began aggressively labeling his false tweets about supposedly widespread election fraud as disputed. An actual permanent suspension had been all but unimaginable -- at least until he lost his bid for re-election.

In May, after Trump tweeted the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" in response to protests in Minneapolis, Twitter added a warning label to his post for the first time. Tensions between Trump and Twitter only escalated from there.

Banning Trump entirely was a big step for the company — if one that it avoided taking until the president was a lame duck and its larger rival, Facebook, already banned him indefinitely."
1816	"Renewed Interest in Missing Man Daniel Robinson Case After Gabby Petito's Body Found

The recent discovery of Gabby Petito's body in Wyoming has reignited interest in the case of missing man Daniel Robinson, who disappeared in Arizona in June. Robinson, a geologist, was last seen leaving a job site in the Arizona desert on June 23, driving a 2017 blue Jeep Renegade. His last known location was near Sun Valley Parkway and Cactus Road.

Daniel Robinson is described as 5-foot-8 with black hair and brown eyes, and is missing his right forearm and hand. His damaged vehicle was found on July 19 near a ravine, with personal items inside, but no sign of Daniel. A human skull found on July 31 was not identified as Daniel's, and foul play is not suspected by investigators.

David Robinson II, Daniel's father, has initiated a GoFundMe for a private investigation and search efforts, raising over $34,000. ""We just want to find our son and bring him home,"" Robinson said in a statement.

Private investigator Jeff McGrath, who has been working on the case, discovered that the Jeep was driven 11 miles post-crash, with several attempts to restart the engine. ""It's clear that whoever was driving the car was trying to get away from the crash site,"" McGrath said.

An online petition calling for further investigation by police has amassed over 5,700 signatures. Shayla Davis, a social media user who started the petition, said, ""We need to bring attention to this case and make sure that Daniel's family gets the answers they deserve.""

Despite the renewed interest in the case, the Buckeye Police Department has stated that they have thoroughly searched and analyzed evidence but found no new leads on Daniel's whereabouts. ""We understand the concerns of the public, but we need concrete evidence to move forward with the investigation,"" a spokesperson for the department said.

The discovery of Gabby Petito's body has sparked a national conversation about missing persons cases and the need for more resources and attention to be devoted to these cases. ""It's heartbreaking that it takes a tragedy like this to bring attention to the issue, but we hope that Daniel's case will also receive the attention it deserves,"" Robinson said.

As the search for Daniel Robinson continues, his family and friends remain hopeful that he will be found safe and sound. ""We will not give up until we find Daniel,"" McGrath said.

The public is urged to contact the Buckeye Police Department with any information that may lead to Daniel's whereabouts. ""We need the public's help to bring Daniel home,"" Robinson said.

The case of Daniel Robinson is a reminder that there are many missing persons cases that need attention and resources. As the search for Daniel continues, it is hoped that his case will bring attention to the issue of missing persons and the need for more support for families who are searching for their loved ones.

In conclusion, the discovery of Gabby Petito's body has brought renewed attention to the case of missing man Daniel Robinson. While the investigation continues, the public is urged to come forward with any information that may lead to Daniel's whereabouts. The family and friends of Daniel Robinson remain hopeful that he will be found safe and sound, and the case serves as a reminder of the need for more resources and attention to be devoted to missing persons cases."
1057	"GoFundMe's Shifting Stance on Fundraising for Legal Defenses Raises Questions of Fairness and Morality

In a recent turn of events, GoFundMe's policies on fundraising for legal defenses have come under scrutiny following the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse, who was charged with violent crimes, was found not guilty, leading GoFundMe to clarify its Terms of Service regarding fundraisers for individuals in similar situations. However, the company's stance has sparked debate over fairness and the potential for wrongful convictions.

According to GoFundMe's Terms of Service, the platform disallows fundraisers for individuals charged with violent crimes. However, following Rittenhouse's acquittal, the company clarified that individuals acquitted of such charges could have fundraisers for legal defense and living expenses. This shift in policy has raised questions about the moral authority and consistency of GoFundMe's policies.

The situation has also sparked backlash against GoFundMe, with the company facing criticism for disabling replies to its tweet explaining the policy. In response, GoFundMe posted a detailed explanation on Medium about its Terms of Service, emphasizing its commitment to preventing fundraisers that support hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, or involve weaponry.

Despite GoFundMe's efforts to clarify its policies, the situation has highlighted the challenges of balancing fairness and consistency in fundraising for legal defenses. The company's insistence that it continually evaluates and evolves its Terms of Service to address new factors suggests that it is committed to prioritizing human rights in its fundraising policies.

However, the debate over GoFundMe's policies raises important questions about the potential for wrongful convictions and the need for a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to fundraising for legal defenses. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how GoFundMe will address these concerns and maintain its position as a leading platform for fundraising.

In conclusion, GoFundMe's shifting stance on fundraising for legal defenses has raised important questions about fairness, consistency, and the moral authority of its policies. While the company's commitment to prioritizing human rights is commendable, the situation highlights the need for a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to fundraising for legal defenses. As the debate continues, it is crucial that GoFundMe and other fundraising platforms prioritize fairness, consistency, and the protection of human rights in their policies."
336	"Trump sues Facebook, Twitter and Google over social media bans

Former US President Donald Trump filed three separate class-action lawsuits against the tech giants in federal court in Florida on Wednesday.

Former President Donald Trump sued Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and their chief executives, raising the stakes in his battle against social media giants who have blocked him.

Billing the effort during a Wednesday press conference as a move to defend First Amendment rights, Trump filed three separate class-action lawsuits in federal court in Florida against the tech giants and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pichai.

The lawsuits seek court orders to restore his social-media accounts, along with punitive damages, to ensure other users can't be banned or flagged by the tech giants. The legal team is being led by John P. Coale, a trial attorney involved in lawsuits against big tobacco companies.

""We're going to hold big tech very accountable,"" Trump said during the press conference at his Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey. ""If they can do it to me, they can do it to anyone.""

Twitter permanently banned Trump in January for his role in stoking the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6 in a deadly riot to stop the counting of Electoral College votes for President Joe Biden. Facebook last month said Trump would remain suspended from its networks for at least two years, with the possibility of being reinstated in 2023 if risk to public safety has subsided.

YouTube, Google's giant video service, also froze Trump's account following the Jan. 6 riot. The former president's videos are still accessible, but he isn't permitted to post new videos. Susan Wojcicki, YouTube's chief executive, has said that the company will reverse its policy when it decides that the ""risk of violence has decreased,"" without providing details.

Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the suits, which were criticized by tech-funded advocacy groups. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and other tech companies, said the action shows a ""deliberate misunderstanding of the First Amendment"" and is without merit.

""President Trump has no case,"" NetChoice CEO Steve DelBianco said in a release. ""The First Amendment is designed to protect the media from the President, not the other way around.""

Trump is seeking to overturn a federal law that shields internet companies from liability for content posted by users. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act protects social media platforms from lawsuits accusing them of unfairly removing posts or accounts, among other legal challenges. The First Amendment prohibits the government from forcing tech companies to leave up or take down certain categories of posts.

In the lawsuits, Trump argues the liability protections under Section 230 means social media companies should be considered government actors that can be sued.

The banishment of Trump by major tech platforms reignited Republican calls to revoke the legal shield, arguing that it has enabled social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to censor conservative viewpoints.

The lawsuits aren't the first time Trump has taken aim at Section 230. While in office, he tried to get Congress to repeal Section 230 by threatening to veto a Defense Department spending bill. Democrats have also proposed bills to curtail the legal shield to encourage tech companies to more aggressively rid their platforms of bigotry, abuse, and harassment.

Tech companies have largely resisted changes to the law, fearing that the proliferation of lawsuits will force them to clamp down on the free-flowing user-generated content. However, both Zuckerberg and Dorsey have expressed openness in recent months to Section 230 reforms.

Without access to the broad reach afforded by social media giants, Trump has struggled to maintain an online presence. He shut down his blog-like ""From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,"" though he frequently sends out several press statements a day — often targeting fellow Republicans he believes are insufficiently loyal.

Trump recently stepped up his public activity by restarting rallies and making a trip to the southern U.S. border last week to criticize Biden's immigration policies. He's backing candidates in the 2022 midterm elections and actively opposing others. He has also held out the prospect of running again for president in 2024.

The former president has been teasing that he'll launch a new platform that can't remove him. He said on Dave Rubin's ""Rubin Report"" podcast on June 25 that ""there's a lot of platforms out there, that's what we're looking at, getting the right platform, a perfect platform, and I think you'll see something fairly soon.""

During his presidency, Trump used Twitter for everything from insulting rivals to major policy announcements, and he relied on Facebook especially to raise money from small-dollar donors.

A Florida law prohibiting social media platforms from suspending the accounts of political candidates was blocked by a federal judge earlier this month. Likening the state's law to ""burning the house to roast a pig,"" U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee said the legislation passed by a Republican legislature and a priority of Governor Ron DeSantis, violates the companies' free speech rights.

The case is Trump et al v Twitter Inc et al, 21-cv-22441, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami)."
111	"Kyle Rittenhouse Trial Delayed by 7 Months as Both Sides Seek More Preparation Time

The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager accused of shooting three protesters, killing two, during a Wisconsin protest in August 2020, has been delayed by seven months. The trial, which was originally set to begin on March 29, has been rescheduled to November 1, with a status hearing on May 17.

Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder approved the delay, which was requested by both the prosecution and defense, citing the need for more time to prepare for the case.

Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, faces multiple charges, including reckless homicide and being a minor in possession of a firearm. He has argued that he acted in self-defense, claiming that he was threatened by the protesters.

The incident took place during protests that erupted after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, leaving him paralyzed. Rittenhouse is accused of killing two protesters, Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, and wounding a third, Gaige Grosskreutz, with an AR-15-style rifle.

The case has become a focal point in debates over gun rights and racial injustice, with Rittenhouse receiving support from conservatives who see him as a symbol of Second Amendment rights. Others, however, view him as a symbol of white supremacy and systemic racism.

Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger argued that the delay was necessary to allow for more time to review evidence and prepare witnesses. ""We have a lot of witnesses to interview and a lot of evidence to review,"" Binger said. ""We want to make sure that we have enough time to do a thorough investigation.""

Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, echoed Binger's sentiments, saying that the defense also needed more time to prepare. ""We have a lot of work to do, and we want to make sure that we have enough time to do it right,"" Richards said.

The delay in the Rittenhouse trial echoes broader legal reckonings with the Black Lives Matter movement and related incidents. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases involving police violence against black people, leading to widespread protests and calls for reform.

The Rittenhouse case has also highlighted the issue of gun violence and the role of firearms in American society. Rittenhouse's use of an AR-15-style rifle has sparked renewed calls for stricter gun control measures, while others have argued that he was within his rights to defend himself with a firearm.

As the legal system grapples with these complex issues, the Rittenhouse trial is likely to remain a focal point of national attention. The delay may be seen as a setback for those seeking justice for the victims, but it is also a recognition of the need for a thorough and fair trial.

Ultimately, the outcome of the trial will have far-reaching implications, not just for Rittenhouse, but for the broader community and the nation as a whole. It will be a test of the legal system's ability to address issues of race, violence, and justice in a society that remains deeply divided on these issues."
387	"A decision to acquit a 20-year-old white Wisconsin man accused of killing two black men last year has been widely seen as a case of injustice. But Kyle Rittenhouse's acquittal has also led to important shifts in the legal system and the media.

The Milwaukee native, who was acquitted on all charges, has been found not guilty in a manslaughter trial on the second day of deliberations. He was acquitted of first-degree intentional homicide and will have his rights reinstated next month. Rittenhouse has been released on bond.

The decision was largely viewed in the media as a case of injustice, as Rittenhouse, who is not affiliated with any political party, was not charged with any racially motivated violence.

But the Rittenhouse case has also been an opportunity to examine some of the many legal issues raised by the case, including:

Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges, with the jury arguing that he acted in self-defense during an August 2018 altercation with two black men.

What about Rittenhouse's acquittal did you find particularly striking? What about what has changed about the legal system that might be good for society? How has the media reacted to this decision? Is there a way in which we can use this as an opportunity to improve? You can submit your thoughts to Daily Wire by clicking here. A police officer in the county in which Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly killed two black men has had his job taken away from him after making a statement about the case in which he supported Rittenhouse, USA Today reports. William Kelly, 51, had nearly 20 years of service with Norfolk police and had made his comments on Facebook. Kelly is accused of refusing to tell authorities that he had seen video of Rittenhouse shooting two black men in broad daylight in 2017, USA Today notes, citing the sheriff's office. Kelly resigned from Norfolk police in March after Rittenhouse's acquittal, according to the sheriff's office. He was accused of making comments about Rittenhouse during an interview with the Milwaukee Sentinel in April. Kelly's firing was announced Monday on the Norfolk police department's Facebook page, which noted that Kelly had resigned and was no longer employed by Norfolk. Kelly had been involved in Rittenhouse's defense, the sheriff's office said. Kelly's attorney says Kelly did not tell the sheriff's office that he had seen videos of Rittenhouse shooting two men because he does not know what could have happened to him, USA Today reports. Kelly's attorney said he wasn't aware of the sheriff's office's explanation for Kelly's firing. ""He has no comment,"" a lawyer for Kelly said."
1267	"Cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline Highlights Vulnerabilities in Critical Infrastructure

The recent cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline Co. system, which led to its shutdown, has raised pressing questions about the resilience of critical infrastructure to such threats in the future. The attack, which significantly disrupted fuel supply along the East Coast, has spotlighted the vulnerability of physical infrastructure in the face of rising cyber threats, particularly ransomware.

Cybersecurity professionals are sounding the alarm over the growing risk of attacks on physical infrastructure. This concern is amplified by the increase in connected legacy assets, which are seen as easy targets for cybercriminals. Nicholas Friedman, National Managing Partner and Governance, Risk, and Compliance Strategist at Templar Shield Inc., emphasized the escalating threat, stating, ""The convergence of IT and operational technology (OT) systems has opened up new avenues for attacks that can have direct, physical effects on our daily lives.""

In response to the Colonial cyberattack, the U.S. government took immediate action, signaling the far-reaching implications of such disruptions on fuel prices and supplies. Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, highlighted efforts to prevent ransomware from transitioning from IT systems to those controlling operational technology. ""Our priority is to strengthen the resilience of our infrastructure against such attacks,"" Neuberger said, emphasizing the government's commitment to bolstering cybersecurity measures.

The attack has sparked discussions among industry experts about the necessity for improved visibility and more sophisticated defense-in-depth strategies. This approach would enable a more precise response to cyberattacks, potentially mitigating the impact on critical infrastructure. Alex Bagwell, Vice President for Industrial Sales at Tripwire Inc., noted, ""Better visibility into systems and implementing layered security measures are essential first steps in defending against sophisticated cyber threats.""

Questions have been raised about Colonial's ability to monitor its own systems and whether a more targeted approach to the shutdown could have been employed. This has brought to light the importance of understanding one's network deeply and having effective detection and response capabilities in place. Leo Simonovich, Vice President and Global Head of Industrial Cyber and Digital Security at Siemens Energy AG, remarked on this, stating, ""Knowing your assets and how they are connected is fundamental to assessing vulnerabilities and responding effectively to threats.""

Despite best practices advocating for multiple layers of protection and network segmentation, incidents like the one affecting Colonial underscore that no system is completely invulnerable. Johan Vermij, a Research Analyst specializing in the internet of things at 451 Research, pointed out, ""Even with the best security protocols, the possibility of a breach can never be eliminated entirely. It's about reducing risk to a manageable level.""

The incident also prompted calls for more flexible policies and the development of additional pipeline infrastructure to provide redundancy, which could prevent such widespread disruptions in future. Experts argue that securing OT systems presents unique challenges, given their design focus on reliability and maintenance over cybersecurity.

Barbara Rembiesa, President and CEO of the International Association of IT Asset Managers, advocated for a comprehensive approach to OT security. ""Detailed asset inventories and thorough business impact analyses are critical components of building resilience,"" she said. This incident has highlighted the need for a robust, multi-faceted approach to cybersecurity in the face of an ever-evolving threat landscape, ensuring the safety and reliability of critical infrastructure now and into the future."
438	"Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick Honored with Lie in State at U.S. Capitol

In a solemn ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick was remembered for his bravery and sacrifice during the January 6 riot. Sicknick, who succumbed to injuries sustained during the violent unrest, became the fifth person to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda.

Congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), paid tribute to Sicknick during the emotional ceremony. Pelosi described him as a ""patriot,"" praising his dedication to the country and his role in protecting democracy.

""Officer Brian Sicknick was a hero who answered the call to protect our Capitol and our Country,"" Pelosi said. ""His sacrifice reminds us of our obligation to defend our Democracy and to honor his memory by continuing the work he began.""

Schumer also spoke of Sicknick's heroism, recalling him as a ""good, kind man."" Schumer's voice was filled with emotion as he described the personal loss felt by many. ""Officer Sicknick gave his life protecting the Capitol and our democracy,"" Schumer said. ""He will be remembered not just for his bravery, but for who he was – a good man, a dedicated public servant, and a loving son and brother.""

Sicknick's family attended the ceremony, alongside members of Congress. Family members wept as they watched the tribute to their loved one. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), House Majority Leader, read a statement from Sicknick's mother, Gladys Sicknick, who expressed her gratitude for the honor bestowed upon her son.

President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden paid their respects to Sicknick on Tuesday night. In a statement, the President called Sicknick ""a hero who lost his life protecting the Capitol and our democracy.""

A viewing session was held for Capitol Police officers and other law enforcement personnel to honor Sicknick. Hundreds of officers gathered to pay their respects to their fallen colleague. Following the memorial service, Sicknick's remains were to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Both Pelosi and Schumer emphasized Sicknick's role in protecting democracy on January 6. Pelosi stated, ""Officer Sicknick's final act of defending the Capitol and our country remains a testament to his heroism and sacrifice.""

Schumer added, ""We will never forget Officer Sicknick's bravery in the face of an insurrection that sought to undermine our democracy.""

As the ceremony came to a close, the somber atmosphere in the Capitol Rotunda served as a reminder of the sacrifices made to protect our nation. Officer Brian Sicknick will forever be remembered as a patriot and a hero."

935	"Some 200,000 animals trapped in Suez canal likely to die

The worst maritime animal welfare tragedy in history could, by now, be unavoidable, says Gabrile Păun, the EU director for Animals International, an NGO.

There are 16 ships taking live animals from the EU to the Persian Gulf which have been stuck for several days behind the stranded 'Ever Given' cargo vessel in the Suez Canal.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

Even with the Ever Given now slowly moving again, the live animals inside the blistering cargo containers, which are quickly running out of feed and water, are now nearing an even more tragic end than that which awaits them in the slaughterhouses at their destination.

Even if the ships were to resume full course today, the water and food would not last until their sea journey is over.

Romania is the source for the 130,000 of the 200,000 live animals now caught in the Suez bottleneck.

Some six of the 11 ships full to the brim with the live animals from the South-Eastern European nation are in a particularly critical situation. They were supposed to reach harbours in the Persian Gulf over four days ago, but still have not left the Canal.

According to EU law, ships carrying live animals need to load 25 percent more food than planned for their trip in case of delays, but animal welfare organisations warned that this rarely happens.

Meanwhile, Păun explained to EUobserver that even with the 25 percent buffer, these ships would now run out of animal feed long before they arrive in port.

""A ship that left Romania on 16 March was scheduled to arrive in Jordan on 23 March, but instead it would now reach port on 1 April at the earliest. That is a nine-day delay. Even if the ship had the required 25 percent additional animal feed, it would only have lasted for 1.5 days"", he said.

The 'ANSVSA', the Romanian authority in charge of live-animal exports issued a press release two days ago saying that after reaching out to those in charge on board the ships, there is enough food and water to last a few days.

The press release added that live animal exports have been currently suspended until the situation in the Suez is dealt with.

But for Păun, those responsible for the shipment would never admit that animals are dying by the thousands on their vessels.

Meanwhile, the EU legislation does not compel an EU member state to report on animal mortality on board these ships and Romania would never release that information voluntarily because authorities know that it would lead to investigations, he added.

Romania is one of Europe's largest live-sheep exporters and has several times been singled out by the European Commission for its bad practices regarding live-animal exports.

Last year, Romania was red-flagged by Brussels for failing to meet live-animal transport conditions after more than 14,000 sheep drowned when a cargo vessel capsized off the Black Sea coast.

A year earlier, the then EU commissioner for food safety, Vytenis Andriukaitis, urged Romania - to no avail - to stop the export of 70,000 live sheep to the Persian Gulf because temperatures inside the cargo vessel exceed 60 degrees Celsius.

Instead, Romanian authorities increased their live-animal exports, despite an investigation that showed animals exported to Gulf countries dying from the high temperatures, being unloaded violently off ships, squeezed into car trunks, and slaughtered by unskilled butchers.

Păun says the only chance now for some of the animals to make it to destination alive is for Egyptian authorities to move quickly and clear the ships trapped in the Suez.

""I am appalled that legislation did not offer Romania the power to command cargo ships to return back home. Romania should have used diplomatic pressure to resolve the issue,"" he said.

""According to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the EU member state exporting live animals to a third party country is responsible for their wellbeing until reaching destination"", he added."
1453	"Ever Given's Suez Canal Snafu Sparks Multi-Million Dollar Legal and Insurance Dispute

The grounding of the Ever Given, a massive container ship, in the Suez Canal has triggered a complex legal and insurance battle involving the principle of general average, which requires shippers to share losses in certain circumstances. The incident has brought into focus the little-known but critical aspect of maritime law, which can have significant financial implications for all parties involved.

According to Joe Klobus, Claims and Insurance Manager at OEC Group, ""General average is the equitable sharing of loss between vessel owners and cargo interests under the York Antwerp Rules."" The principle can be invoked for various reasons beyond vessel fires or overboard containers, including salvage operations and seeking refuge. In the case of the Ever Given, the vessel's owners, not Evergreen specifically, invoked general average for the incident.

The increasing frequency of incidents like containers falling overboard has made general average declarations more common. However, Evergreen, while not technically liable, faces a public and legal challenge regarding the financial implications of the blockade. Egyptian authorities have cited a $900 million figure, which includes various claims, with $300 million each for a salvage bonus and loss of reputation.

Vessels delayed due to the Ever Given's grounding likely cannot declare general average as delay doesn't fit within the York Antwerp Rules. This means that shippers whose cargo was delayed or lost during the incident may not be able to recover their losses through the principle of general average.

Shippers entering contracts should be aware of general average, though many may not understand its full implications. ""It's important for shippers to understand that general average can be declared in a variety of situations, and it's not just limited to fires or overboard containers,"" says Klobus.

The financial implications of the Ever Given's grounding could have far-reaching consequences for the shipping industry and consumers alike. Charges levied against the Ever Given and other ships could be rolled into landed costs, affecting the market and potentially leading to higher consumer prices.

The incident highlights the importance of careful contract drafting and risk assessment in the shipping industry. ""It's crucial for shippers to carefully review their contracts and understand their exposure to risks like general average,"" notes Klobus.

The legal and insurance dispute surrounding the Ever Given's grounding is likely to be a complex and lengthy process. As the situation unfolds, it's clear that the principle of general average will continue to play a critical role in the shipping industry, and shippers must be aware of its implications to avoid costly surprises.

In conclusion, the Ever Given's Suez Canal snafu has sparked a multi-million dollar legal and insurance dispute that highlights the importance of understanding the principle of general average in the shipping industry. As the incident continues to make headlines, it's clear that the financial implications will be felt far beyond the Suez Canal."
506	"Votes over polarising lawmakers test GOP unity ahead of Trump impeachment trial

House Republicans decided Wednesday to stand by two GOP lawmakers who have polarized the party, voting to retain Rep. Liz Cheney as their No. 3 leader and saying they'd fight a Democratic push to kick Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off her committees.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has shown support on social media for calls to violence against Democrats and a range of conspiracy theories. Her Twitter account was suspended in January after she repeated allegations of fraud in the US presidential election

In a 145-61 vote by secret ballot, House Republicans overwhelmingly rebuffed a rebellion by hard-right conservatives to toss Cheney, R-Wyo., over her vote last month to impeach then-President Donald Trump.

Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ridiculed Democrats for slating a House vote on Thursday that would remove Greene from her committees. McCarthy's comment was a signal that he was dismissing bipartisan demands that the hard-right Georgia Republican be punished for her online embrace of racist and violent views and bizarre conspiracy theories.

The decisions over Greene and Cheney have subjected the GOP to a politically agonizing test of its direction as it moves beyond the Trump presidency. Since he grudgingly vacated the White House last month, the party has been ideologically adrift as it's struggled over whether to embrace his norm-busting divisiveness or the party's more traditional, policy-oriented conservative values.

But shortly after the Democratic-led House Rules Committee cleared the way for Thursday's vote, McCarthy released a statement saying Democrats were ""choosing to raise the temperature"" by attempting a ""partisan power grab.""

McCarthy condemned Greene's past endorsements of conspiracy theories — after weeks of saying little critical of her — and said the first-term congresswoman had recognized in a private conversation that she must meet ""a higher standard"" as a lawmaker. Greene has shown support for calls to violence against Democrats and bizarre fictions about faked school shootings.

""I hold her to her word, as well as her actions going forward,"" McCarthy said.

00:30

Cheney is a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a fixture of the party establishment. She was among just 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump last month.

""I won't apologize for the vote,"" Cheney told her colleagues in the closed-door session, according to a person familiar with the session who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.

During a break in that closed-door session, McCarthy told reporters he'd defended Cheney inside.

""People can have differences of opinion. That's what you can have a discussion about. Liz has a right to vote her conscience,"" said McCarthy, who'd previously given no clear signal about whether he'd support his lieutenant.

At the earlier Rules Committee meeting, Chair Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said lawmakers would send ""an awful message"" if they took no action on Greene. ""If this is not the bottom, I don't know what the hell is,"" McGovern said.

McCarthy tried to push blame onto Democrats, criticizing them for taking no action against their own lawmakers whom he didn't name, including one he said ""spread anti-Semitic tropes."" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., made comments critical of Israel in 2019 and apologized.

The internal GOP fight over how to handle Greene and Cheney underscored the hold Trump and his voters still have on much of the party. But it's not uniform.

Around two-thirds of House Republicans voted to back Trump's effort to overturn his November election loss — just hours after his supporters' deadly storming of the Capitol that led to his impeachment for inciting insurrection. Yet Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other GOP senators have lambasted Greene, reflecting worries that her wing of the party cannot win statewide Senate races.

House Republicans had faced bipartisan pressure to punish Greene, including from McConnell. A House vote was expected to be a political ordeal for many Republicans, forcing them to go on record defending or punishing the unapologetic, social media-savvy Greene.

She burst onto the national political scene after just a month in office and with enthusiastic support from Trump. Even during the effort to punish her, she has lashed out at Democrats and raised money on the controversy.

Republicans appointed Greene to the Education and Labor Committee, a decision that drew especially harsh criticism because of her suggestions that mass school shootings in Connecticut and Florida could be hoaxes. Greene is also on the Budget Committee.

McCarthy said Democrats turned down his offer to move Greene onto the House Small Business Committee instead."
1354	"Citigroup's $900 Million Defeat

Citi's expensive day in court

Citigroup made a huge mistake last summer, when instead of transferring an $8 million interest payment from Revlon to its creditors, it transferred nearly $900 million of the bank's own funds — the full amount of principal on the loan that wasn't due for another few years. Some creditors promptly returned $400 million of the mistakenly wired money, but 10 others refused to return $500 million. The dispute ended up in court.

Yesterday, unexpectedly, a New York federal judge said the firms could keep the cash, despite acknowledging that the money had been transferred in error.

Wait, what? The lenders argued that the transfers matched what they were owed, so they could have ""reasonably thought the payments were intentional,"" assuming that it would be ""downright irrational"" for Citi to make such a big mistake, the judge, Jesse Furman, concluded. He might have ruled differently if he could ""write on a blank slate,"" but there were legal precedents supporting the defendants.

""New York law wants to discourage banks from making these kinds of mistakes,"" said Adam Abensohn of Quinn Emanuel, who represented the asset managers. ""It's one thing to mistakenly send money to someone with no entitlement to that payment,"" he told DealBook. ""But there is nothing unfair about keeping that money when it's owed.""

""At its heart, this case involves a clash between two basic intuitive principles,"" the judge said:

""If one party sends money to another by mistake, the latter should generally be required to give it back.""

""On the other hand, if one party owes money to another and pays that money back to the penny, the latter should generally be allowed to keep and use the money as it wishes, without fear that the former will develop a case of borrower's remorse and claim that the payment was by mistake.""

Where do you stand? The decision — which Citi will probably appeal — raises thorny questions about rules versus principles:

Since it was a mistake by the bank, why not return the money?

What responsibility do creditors have to the bank if it pays them back early?

This has generated a fascinating debate here at DealBook, and we'd like to hear what you think: Email us at dealbook@nytimes.com. Include your name and location, and we may feature your response in a future newsletter."
1725	"Scene at Hollywood Reporter: Alleged Murder of Film's Cinematographer

Horror and horror films are becoming ever more popular in the entertainment industry. In recent years, the industry has been plagued by rumors of widespread violence, fear, and even fatal accidents.

However, there is one film that has garnered significant media attention, and it is 'Rust.' This is the story of a talented director who has been in the spotlight for some time. Despite the fact that he is still in the process of making his film, Rust is still working hard to bring his vision of cinema to life.

The cast of 'Rust' includes a variety of actors, including Max Brooks (The Godfather), Robert De Niro (House of Cards), Jack White (Aliens), David Harbour (The Godfather 2), and Carrie-Anne Moss (The Chronicles of Narnia).

It is unclear at this time how the closure of the production will affect Rust, but there is optimism that his film will have a lasting effect on the industry. There is no doubt that this is a story that needs to be told in order to reach its conclusion.

However, the possibility of criminal charges and civil lawsuits remains a reality for actors, directors, and producers. With the death of a talented filmmaker and the death of the film, it is inevitable that the film will have a lasting impact on the entertainment industry and the lives of its stars.

I believe that the closure of 'Rust' is a call to action for the entertainment industry, and for the actors and directors to take steps to help bring this film to life. They should not be afraid to take their careers to the next level, and to speak up if possible to protect the future of their work.

Please share this article and tell everyone you know about the tragic death of a talented filmmaker and the potential legal and financial consequences. Stay informed and keep pushing for the truth!

1260	"The lighter days of CNN's Cuomo Brothers show are long gone

NEW YORK (AP) — Some television shows age much better than others.

For CNN, last spring's prime-time banter between Chris Cuomo and his older brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, looks worse in hindsight as the governor's administration is questioned about its role in failing to disclose the true number of COVID-19 nursing home deaths.

CNN is covering that story, but not on Chris Cuomo's show. The network said it had reinstated a prohibition on Cuomo interviewing or doing stories about his brother that it had temporarily lifted last spring.

The brothers were both in the spotlight last March. Chris Cuomo caught COVID-19 and continued anchoring his show from his basement, while the governor dealt with New York's hellish days as the nation's early coronavirus epicenter. Andrew Cuomo's near-daily briefing was widely televised and, to some viewers, embraced as a counterpoint to those held by former President Donald Trump.

Nine times between March 19 and June 24, 2020, the governor appeared on his brother's show. The trash-talking and brotherly love between the two Italians from Queens was fun if occasionally cheesy, like when Chris Cuomo mocked his brother's big nose with a giant cotton swab he said would be necessary to give him a COVID-19 test.

""I found these interviews to be very entertaining, and perhaps Chris could ask questions of his brother that other people can't,"" said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University. ""But from the very beginning, I thought it was wildly inappropriate.

""It's Journalism 101,"" he said. ""We tell our students you shouldn't interview your family and friends.""

The policy avoids a conflict of interest — can one brother really be expected to ask tough questions of another? — or at the very least the appearance of one.

Through a spokeswoman, CNN said that the early months of the pandemic were an extraordinary time.

""We felt that Chris speaking with his brother about the challenges of what millions of American families were struggling with was of significant human interest,"" CNN said. ""As a result, we made an exception to a rule that we have had in place since 2013 which prevents Chris from interviewing his brother, and that rule remains in place today."""
1215	"Tennessee Man Pleads Guilty to Capitol Riot Charge

Bryan Wayne Ivey, a Tennessee native, has admitted to his role in the January 6th Capitol riot, pleading guilty to a minor protest-related charge. In a recent court appearance, Ivey acknowledged entering restricted areas during the chaos that unfolded, accepting responsibility for one misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing inside Capitol grounds.

As part of his plea agreement, Ivey has agreed to pay $500 in restitution to the United States. The consequences he faces could include prison time, a fine, or probation. This development comes after Ivey was apprehended on March 4 in Tennessee on four charges related to his participation in the riot, with the remainder of the charges dropped pursuant to his plea deal.

Leslie Goemaat, Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C., highlighted the events leading to Ivey's arrest. A tipster identified him through social media photos amidst the crowd at the Capitol. Court records indicate that although Ivey did not personally break a window, he was an onlooker as another protester committed the act.

The journey to Washington, D.C., was a family affair for Ivey, who traveled with his wife and brother. Neither relative entered the Capitol during the riot. The court has scheduled a sentencing hearing for Sept. 28, with Ivey potentially facing up to six months in prison, a $5,000 fine, and/or one year of probation.

Robert David Baker, a Middle Tennessee public defender, emphasized the mitigation efforts to be presented at the upcoming sentencing. ""We plan to present a comprehensive picture of Mr. Ivey and the circumstances surrounding his actions on that day,"" Baker stated. This case marks the first instance of a defendant with Tennessee ties pleading guilty in connection with the tumultuous events of January 6th."
287	"President Biden Vows to Hunt Down Kabul Airport Attackers, Calls Fallen Service Members 'Heroes'

Washington, D.C. - In a somber address to the nation, President Joe Biden vowed to ""hunt down"" those responsible for the deadly attack outside Kabul's airport, pledging that the United States would ""not forgive"" or ""forget"" the perpetrators. The attack, carried out by Islamic State fighters, resulted in the tragic loss of 13 U.S. service members and dozens of Afghan civilians, casting a pall over the ongoing evacuation efforts in Afghanistan.

A Promise to Hold the Perpetrators Accountable

With a resolute tone, President Biden declared, ""We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay."" The president's words echoed a determination to bring justice to the victims and their families, underscoring the gravity of the attack and the unwavering commitment of the United States to hold the perpetrators accountable.

Honoring the Fallen Heroes

In a poignant moment of remembrance, President Biden paid tribute to the fallen service members, describing them as ""heroes"" and the ""backbone of America."" He offered his deepest condolences to the families of the deceased, acknowledging the immense sacrifice they had made in service to their country. A solemn moment of silence was observed in their honor, a tangible expression of the nation's grief and gratitude.

Terrorism Will Not Deter the United States

Despite the devastating attack, President Biden emphasized that terrorism would not deter the United States from continuing its mission to evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies from Afghanistan. He affirmed, ""We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop us from doing what we came to do."" The president's unwavering resolve signaled a commitment to completing the evacuation mission, even in the face of adversity.

Evacuation Efforts Continue Amid Heightened Security

Following the attack, evacuation efforts continued at a steady pace, with an additional 12,500 individuals airlifted to safety between Thursday and Friday morning, according to the White House. Despite the heightened security concerns, the U.S. military remained committed to facilitating the safe passage of evacuees.

Details of the Attack Emerge

Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., head of U.S. Central Command, provided further details about the attack, confirming that it involved a suicide bombing followed by gunfire from Islamic State gunmen. He acknowledged a ""failure somewhere"" in security measures, as the bomber was being screened by American forces at a gate when the explosion occurred.

Clarification on Bombing Reports

The Pentagon later corrected initial reports, clarifying that there was only one bombing, not two, as previously believed. This adjustment provided a more accurate account of the events that unfolded during the attack.

Evacuation Progress Amid Challenging Circumstances

Despite the tragic attack, ongoing evacuations have managed to transport more than 104,000 civilians to safety since August 14, including approximately 5,000 Americans. These efforts underscore the unwavering commitment of the U.S. military to fulfilling its mission, even in the face of immense challenges and security threats.

President Biden's unwavering commitment to holding the perpetrators accountable for the Kabul airport attack reflects the nation's resolve to combat terrorism and protect its citizens. Despite the tragic loss of life, the ongoing evacuation efforts demonstrate the United States' dedication to fulfilling its mission and ensuring the safety of those seeking refuge. As the situation in Afghanistan remains fluid, the world watches with anticipation as the United States navigates this complex and challenging chapter in its history."

1074	"Lady Gaga Wore Schiaparelli Couture for Biden Inauguration — Lady Gaga Inauguration Outfit

Update: In a recent video for British Vogue, Lady Gaga surveyed 20 of the most iconic looks she has worn throughout her career. Included in the catalogue—along with notable moments like her 2010 ""meat dress"" and her first Academy Award win in 2019 in Brandon Maxwell and Tiffany's yellow diamond—is the custom Schiaparelli Haute Couture design she wore to perform at President Joe Biden's inauguration this past January. ""This is one of my favorite things I've ever worn,"" Gaga says, before revealing that the dress was actually bulletproof.

And choosing Schiaparelli, an Italian designer, was a deeply personal choice for the multihyphenate star: ""When I saw that golden dove, I just knew that this was the right piece, and I knew, Schiaparelli being an Italian fashion house, it was something that I really, really wanted to do for my heritage as an Italian-American woman that would be singing for President 45 to be leaving and to invite President 46 into office,"" she says in the video. Below, our original story from January 2021 on Gaga's custom Schiaparelli creation.

Lady Gaga is never one to shy away from a major fashion moment. Yesterday, when she arrived at the Capitol for the inauguration dress rehearsal, she wore a simple and elegant white cape (via Givenchy by Matthew Williams) with a pretty plait crowning her head. Many fans were quick to note the Princess Leia vibes (see: Carrie Fisher in 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV).

This morning, as she stepped out onto the platform to sing the national anthem for the inauguration ceremony of 46th President Joe Biden, Gaga's look was decidedly more theatrical. The star opted for a custom Schiaparelli haute couture design—a fitted navy cashmere jacket that gave way to a voluminous washed red silk faille skirt. Her hair was in the same braid as the day before, but with a red flower tucked into the back. The crowning glory of the outfit, though, was undoubtedly the giant gilded brooch in the shape of a dove, which, as we all know, is a symbol of peace."

JACKSON, Wyo. — One of the last times Gabby Petito was seen alive involved an argument between Brian Laundrie and wait staff at a Jackson Hole restaurant, according to a pair of witnesses from New Orleans.

""I have chills right now,"" Nina Celie Angelo told Fox News Digital Wednesday. ""It's crazy because it wasn't just like we passed them on the street -- it was a full blown incident.""

Angelo told Fox News she and her boyfriend, Matthew England, were in town for a wedding in late August. They were out to lunch at Merry Piglets, a Tex-Mex restaurant, between 1 and 2 p.m. on Aug. 27, when they said Laundrie began arguing with a waitress. Four and a half hours later, a travel-blogging couple passed Petito's van at a campsite north of town.

Angelo, a photographer, said she couldn't overhear the conversation but that she believed Laundrie was arguing with staff over the bill or about money. She described his body language as ""aggressive"" and said he left and returned about four times.

At one point, Petito came inside and apologized for Laundrie's behavior, Angelo said.

England told Fox News that he reported the incident to the FBI and that Petito appeared ""visibly upset"" with Laundrie as he hounded staff at the Merry Piglets Tex-Mex restaurant.

Petito case sheds light on domestic violence in Utah

The incident happened two days after Petito's final Instagram post in Ogden, Utah and roughly two weeks after we reported that a witness called 911 about a domestic fight between Petito and Laundrie in Moab, Utah.

Angelo and England said bodycam video of the police response matched the mannerisms and body language of Petito and Laundrie they witnessed firsthand. Laundrie was also wearing clothes England said he recognized from the video and ""looked kind of like he had been living out in a van for a little while.""

Moab police Body cam footage released by Moab police shows the aftermath of a fight between Gabby Petito and her boyfriend Brain Laundrie two weeks before she disappeared.

""I spent the last three or four days really kind of racking my brain,"" he told Fox News Wednesday. ""And I woke up this morning and went to Facebook, and there was that video with the police on it, right away. That was the couple.""

Then it clicked.

""I would bet $10 million, I'm 1,000 percent sure that was him and that was her,"" he said.

Aug. 27, the day of the alleged restaurant incident, is the same day Petito last made contact with her friends and family.

On August 29, a woman publicly claimed that she and her boyfriend gave Laundrie a ride and that Laundrie claimed he'd been camping by himself for multiple days while Petito was at their van working on social media posts.

""Her account is plausible, it appears,"" North Port police spokesperson Josh Taylor said.

On September 1, Laundrie arrived at his parent's Florida home alone with the van that he and Petito were traveling in. He retained a lawyer and refused to speak with police.

On September 11, Petito's family officially reported her missing to authorities.

On September 17, after several days of both Petito's family and police pleading with Laundrie's family to cooperate in the investigation, Laundrie's family requested police come to their home, where they shared they haven't seen Brian since September 14.

27	"WHO LISTS SINOPHARM COVID-19 VACCINE FOR EMERGENCY USE, URGING EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION

In a significant stride towards global vaccination efforts against COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. Produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, a subsidiary of the China National Biotec Group (CNBG), this addition bolsters the world's collective response to the pandemic.

Dr Mariângela Simão, the Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products at WHO, conveyed her appreciation for Sinopharm's cooperation and commitment during the evaluation process, stating, ""This affirmation of the Sinopharm vaccine by WHO will facilitate equitable global access, especially for low- and middle-income countries."" She further emphasized the importance of engaging in the COVAX Facility to help ensure more equitable distribution of the vaccine.

The WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) streamlines regulatory approval processes in various countries. It enables rapid vaccine deployment where it is needed most, thereby playing a pivotal role in controlling the pandemic's global spread. The Sinopharm vaccine underwent rigorous assessment as part of the EUL, which includes on-site inspections of production facilities.

The two-dose Sinopharm vaccine is suitable for individuals aged 18 years and above, with each dose administered 21 days apart. WHO's assessment also indicates that no upper age limit is recommended, suggesting that the vaccine is likely to be effective in older adults. However, the organization stresses the necessity of monitoring the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in these age groups during real-world usage.

The EUL process focuses on the safety, efficacy, and quality of novel health products during emergencies. Sinopharm's vaccine is the sixth to receive WHO's emergency use approval, following the Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen, Moderna, and Sinovac vaccines. This development marks yet another milestone in expanding the global vaccine portfolio and increasing equitable access to life-saving immunizations.

With a growing number of vaccines available under the EUL, the WHO aims to facilitate faster regulatory approvals, enabling more countries to gain access to essential COVID-19 vaccines. This ultimately helps to bridge the immunization gap between high-income countries and their lower-income counterparts, bolstering efforts to mitigate the pandemic's devastating impact.

In line with the WHO's global mandate, the organization continues to evaluate and list additional vaccines under the EUL, ensuring accessibility for all countries, regardless of their income status. This approach not only accelerates the global vaccination rollout but also fosters a unified front against COVID-19, bringing the world one step closer to controlling the pandemic's spread.

The WHO's EUL procedure addresses various challenges related to emergency health situations, evaluating the quality, safety, and efficacy of novel health products. Focusing on the critical needs of vulnerable populations and low- and middle-income countries, the EUL aims to expedite the regulatory approval process for essential health products during emergencies.

As the global vaccination campaign continues, the WHO emphasizes the importance of vaccinating priority populations in every country, particularly healthcare workers, the elderly, and those with underlying medical conditions. Ensuring equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines remains a top priority for the international health organization, as it focuses on delivering on its mission to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable.

As the world eagerly awaits the arrival of more vaccines under the WHO's Emergency Use Listing, the Sinopharm vaccine's approval brings hope for a more equitable and inclusive recovery from the pandemic. With unwavering commitment and collaboration, the global community can look forward to a future free from the grasp of COVID-19.

784	"This Is the Cost of a Failed Impeachment

If your memory can reach back to the time before COVID-19—no shame if it can't—you may recall the last big story before the pandemic struck: the impeachment of President Donald Trump.

In December 2019, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, all stemming from a ploy in which he attempted to extort the Ukrainian government into assisting his reelection campaign. In February, the Republican-led Senate voted not to remove him from office. After that, impeachment mostly disappeared from national discourse, barely playing a role in the presidential election, even though it was a historic moment and the idea was stunningly popular, and even though it involved Trump's attempt to scuttle the campaign of Joe Biden, who ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee. But views on Trump were already largely ossified, and besides, there was the pandemic and an economic crisis to deal with.

The memory of impeachment is back with a vengeance this week. Though Biden beat Trump, the president continues to try to overturn Biden's victory. In a phone call on Saturday that was eerily reminiscent of Trump's July 2019 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump tried to pressure Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia (the state, not the country) to do something, anything, to throw the state's results back to him.

David A. Graham: Trump won't just violate the rules again—he's already doing it

During impeachment, Trump's critics, including me, warned repeatedly that if he were not impeached and removed, he'd feel empowered to commit the same offenses again. Trump's current, shambling coup attempt is the price of the Senate's failure to remove him.

Raffensperger, who seems understandably furious over Trump's pressure campaign against him, taped the conversation and then released it to The Washington Post after Trump lied about it on Twitter. The president's MO has not changed since July 2019—in fact, it has scarcely changed over the course of his career. All the hallmarks of the Zelensky call popped up in the Saturday coup call. Trump alternates between wheedling flattery and domineering (though vague) threats. He suggests that Raffensperger owes him one—aren't they on the same team? He presents a proposed miscarriage of justice as a vindication of justice. Just as he did with Zelensky, Trump runs through a litany of wild and false conspiracy theories.

Trump speaks like a mob boss, making his desire clear but never saying explicitly what he wants, so as to maintain deniability. What he says is, ""So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break."" What he means is, Find some way to throw out valid votes so that I can win. (Never mind that the state's results have been certified and its electors seated; Raffensperger's role has concluded.)"
459	"What is BGP, and what role did it play in Facebook's massive outage

On Monday, Facebook was completely knocked offline, taking Instagram and WhatsApp (not to mention a few other websites) down with it. Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, citing sources from inside Facebook, traffic analysis, and the gut instinct that ""it's always DNS or BGP."" Facebook is back up and has since released an explanation detailing how BGP was just a part of its woes (and saying that it more or less worked as intended), but this all raises the question:

What is BGP?

At a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible. Because there are tons of different internet service providers, backbone routers, and servers responsible for your data making it to, say, Facebook, there's a ton of different routes your packets could end up taking. BGP's job is to show them the way and make sure it's the best route.

I've heard BGP described as a system of post offices, an air traffic controller, and more, but I think my favorite explanation was one that likened it to a map. Imagine BGP as a bunch of people making and updating maps that show you how to get to YouTube or Facebook.

BGP is like a map telling your computer whose bridges it has to cross to get to Facebook

When it comes to BGP, the internet is broken up into big networks, known as autonomous systems. You can sort of imagine them as island nations — they're networks that are controlled by a single entity, which could be an ISP, like Comcast, a company, like Facebook, or some other big organization like a government or major university. It would be extremely difficult to build bridges connecting every island to all the others, so BGP is what's responsible for telling you which islands (or autonomous systems) you have to go through to get to your destination.

Since the internet is always changing, the maps need to be updated — you don't want your ISP to lead you down an old road that no longer goes to Google. Because it'd be a massive undertaking to map the entire internet all the time, autonomous systems share their maps. They'll occasionally talk to their island neighbors to see and copy any updates they've made to their maps.

Turn left into the river

Using maps as a framework, it's easy to imagine how things can go wrong. Back when consumers first got access to GPS, there were always jokes about it having you drive off a cliff or into the middle of the desert. The same thing can happen with BGP — if someone makes a mistake, it can end up leading traffic somewhere it's not supposed to go, which will cause problems. If it isn't caught, that mistake will end up on everyone's map. There are other ways this can go wrong, but we'll get to those in a bit.

Yeah, yeah, maps. Give me an example.

Of course! This is massively simplified, but imagine you want to connect to an imaginary tech news website called Convergence. Convergence uses the ISP NetSend, and you use DecadeConnect. In this example, DecadeConnect and NetSend can't talk directly to each other, but your ISP can talk to Border Communications, which can talk to Form, which can talk to NetSend. If that's the only route, then BGP would make sure that you and Convergence could communicate through it. But if alternatively, both DecadeConnect and NetSend were connected to ThirdLevel, BGP would likely choose to route your traffic through it, as it's a shorter hop.

Okay, so BGP is like maps that detail all the fastest ways from you to a website?

Right! Unfortunately, it can get even more complicated because the shortest doesn't always equal best. There are plenty of reasons why a routing algorithm would choose one path over another — cost can be a factor as well, with some networks charging others if they want to include them in their routes.

Mapping unchanging roads is hard; imagine mapping the internet

Also, maps are super tricky! I discovered this just recently trying to plan a trip where roads existed on one map and not another or were different between maps. One road even had three different names across three maps. If it's that hard to pin down for a ""town"" that has all of five roads, imagine what it's like trying to connect the entire internet together. Real roads don't change that often, but websites can move from one country to another or change, add, or subtract service providers, and the internet just has to deal with it.

I remember something like this from my algorithms and data structures class — trying to build algos to find the shortest route.

I'll take your word on that. I dropped out as soon as I heard about graphs."
2057	"COVID-19 Vaccines: Understanding Doses, Efficacy, and Timing

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unprecedented challenges to global health and well-being. In the race to combat the virus, the development of effective vaccines has emerged as a beacon of hope. Among the frontrunners in this endeavor are the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. While each vaccine has its unique characteristics, understanding their dosing schedules, efficacy rates, and immunization timelines is crucial for effective vaccination strategies.

Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna: A Two-Dose Regimen

The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines employ a two-dose regimen to achieve full efficacy against COVID-19. These vaccines utilize messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, a groundbreaking approach that instructs human cells to produce proteins resembling the coronavirus's spike protein. This triggers an immune response, teaching the body to recognize and combat the actual virus if encountered.

Johnson & Johnson: A Single-Dose Solution

In contrast to the two-dose requirement of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine offers a single-dose immunization. This vaccine employs a different technology, utilizing a modified adenovirus to deliver genetic material that prompts the immune system to produce antibodies against the coronavirus.

Timing and Effectiveness of Doses

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires a 3-week interval between the first and second doses, while Moderna's second dose is administered 4 weeks after the first. Full immunity typically develops around 2 weeks after the second dose for both vaccines.

Initial immunity is observed after the first dose of both Pfizer-BioNTech (52-91% effective) and Moderna (50.8-92.1% effective) vaccines. However, the second dose significantly enhances protection, with vaccine effectiveness reaching 95% for Pfizer-BioNTech and 94.1% for Moderna.

Considerations for Dose Timing

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that circumstances may arise where the second dose cannot be administered precisely on the recommended schedule. In such cases, the CDC allows for some flexibility. The second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be administered up to 4 days earlier than the recommended 3-week interval, or up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose in exceptional situations.

Balancing Coverage and Long-Term Immunity

Discussions have emerged regarding the potential benefits of delaying or even eliminating the second dose to increase vaccine coverage, especially in resource-constrained settings. However, concerns have been raised about the potential impact on long-term immunity and the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants.

Mixing Vaccines Not Recommended

The CDC currently does not recommend mixing different COVID-19 vaccines. If the first dose is Pfizer-BioNTech, the second dose should also be Pfizer-BioNTech, and the same applies to Moderna. This recommendation is based on the lack of data on the safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson offer powerful tools in the fight against the pandemic. Understanding the dosing schedules, efficacy rates, and immunization timelines of these vaccines is essential for effective vaccination strategies. While the two-dose regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna provides superior protection, the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine offers a convenient alternative. Balancing vaccine coverage with long-term immunity remains a critical consideration, and the CDC's guidelines provide flexibility in dose timing while emphasizing the importance of completing the recommended regimen. As vaccination efforts continue to expand, adherence to these guidelines will be instrumental in curbing the spread of COVID-19 and restoring global health and well-being."
2104	"Trump's Attempts to Manipulate Elections Show a Consistent Pattern

Subheading: The President's Actions After the Senate's Failure to Remove Him from Office Point to a Clear Goal: Undermining the Legitimacy of the 2020 Election Results

The House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, stemming from a scheme involving Ukraine.

The Republican-led Senate voted not to remove Trump from office in February, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic became a global crisis.

Trump's attempt to pressure Brad Raffensperger of Georgia to overturn the state's election results mirrors his previous actions with Ukraine.

David A. Graham, the author, suggests Trump's behavior has been consistent and reflects a pattern of attempting to manipulate electoral outcomes.

Trump's recent actions are viewed as a direct consequence of the Senate's failure to remove him from office, leading to attempts to undermine the 2020 election results."
886	"Former Ferguson Police Officer, Armed with AR-15, Protests outside Kenosha County Courthouse during Rittenhouse Trial

KENOSHA – A man identified as Jesse Kline, a fired Ferguson, Missouri, police officer, was spotted carrying an AR-15 rifle and yelling obscenities about Black Lives Matter outside the Kenosha County Courthouse during the Kyle Rittenhouse jury deliberations.

Kline, who initially identified himself as 'Maserati Mike,' confirmed he was a former member of the Ferguson Police Department, fired in 2018 over stalking charges that were later dropped. He had joined the Ferguson Police Department in 2015, following the shooting of Michael Brown, which sparked widespread protests.

Protesting outside the Kenosha County Courthouse for three days, Kline brought a gun to the demonstration for a brief period. Kenosha County sheriff's deputies informed Kline he could not have the rifle near the courthouse due to its proximity to a school without a permit.

Kline voluntarily put away his rifle when informed of the Wisconsin law that prohibits knowingly possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school's grounds. He continued to protest without the rifle, using a sound system to play music and a bullhorn, on subsequent days.

Kline claimed he traveled to Kenosha from Arizona for the demonstrations and described his current career as 'an investor.' During his protests, he engaged in provocative behavior, including waving a large, apparent sex toy at the crowd and chanting controversial slogans.

Encountering public confrontation, Kline defended his right to protest and denied attempting to incite violence. ""I came here to exercise my First Amendment rights. I'm not here to start any trouble,"" Kline stated.

However, Kline's actions did not go unnoticed by the public. Many passersby were disturbed by his presence and behavior. One bystander, Lisa Johnson, shared her concerns, ""It's just disturbing to see someone with that kind of weapon here, especially when tensions are already high.""

The Kenosha County Sheriff's Department released a statement, stating, ""We take all threats to public safety seriously and are actively monitoring the situation. Protesters are encouraged to exercise their First Amendment rights in a peaceful and lawful manner.""

The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, who is charged with the shooting deaths of two men during protests in Kenosha last year, has sparked intense emotions and attracted demonstrators from all over the country. The jury began deliberations on November 10, 2021, and the tension outside the courthouse has been palpable.

As the trial progresses, it remains to be seen how the presence of individuals like Jesse Kline will impact the proceedings and the community.

Meanwhile, the city of Kenosha has been on edge, with businesses boarding up their windows in anticipation of potential unrest. National Guard troops have been deployed to the area to maintain order and ensure public safety.

The trial of Rittenhouse is expected to continue for several more days, and the outcome could have significant implications for the ongoing debate over police brutality, gun rights, and civil unrest in America.

Back in the protest area, Kline continued to express his views, drawing a mixed reaction from the crowd. Some sympathized with his cause, while others were offended by his provocative behavior.

As the sun began to set on another day of protests, Kline stood defiantly, his voice echoing through the courthouse square. The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse may be the focus of national attention, but for many in Kenosha, the real battle is being waged on the streets.

In the days that followed, the protests outside the Kenosha County Courthouse continued, with demonstrators from all walks of life coming together to express their views. The presence of individuals like Jesse Kline, however, added an element of uncertainty and tension to the proceedings.

As the trial progressed, the jury reached a verdict, finding Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all charges. The announcement sparked jubilation among some in the crowd, while others expressed their disappointment and frustration.

Amidst the chaos, Jesse Kline continued to assert his right to protest, using his loudspeaker and bullhorn to amplify his message. His provocative behavior, however, drew criticism from many in the community.

As the sun set on another day of protests, it was clear that the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse had only served to further divide an already fractured nation. The presence of individuals like Jesse Kline, who came armed and looking for confrontation, only added to the tension and uncertainty.

In the days that followed, the protests outside the Kenosha County Courthouse continued, with demonstrators from all walks of life coming together to express their views. The presence of individuals like Jesse Kline, however, added an element of uncertainty and tension to the proceedings.

Despite the outcome of the trial, the debate over police brutality, gun rights, and civil unrest in America continues. And for many in Kenosha, the real battle is far from over.

As the sun rose on another day in Kenosha, the scene outside the courthouse was once again filled with the sounds of chanting and the sight of protest signs. The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse may have come to an end, but the issues that sparked it remain as divisive as ever."
1724	"Tiger Woods Returns to Competitive Golf at PNC Championship, Nine Months After Severe Car Accident

Tiger Woods, one of the greatest golfers of all time, is set to compete in the PNC Championship alongside his son, Charlie, just nine months after a devastating car accident that left him with severe injuries. Woods suffered open fractures to the tibia and fibula, along with ankle and soft tissue damage in his lower right leg.

The road to recovery has been long and arduous for Woods, who was largely bedridden for three months and began walking with crutches about two months post-accident. Despite the setbacks, Woods has been able to practice golf, focusing on chipping and putting, and playing short-game competitions with his son.

In an interview with Golf.com, Woods acknowledged that his leg and back will never be the same, affecting his ability to maintain a full golfing schedule and practice regimen. ""I'll never be able to practice like I used to,"" Woods said. ""I'll never be able to play as much golf as I used to. My leg and back just won't allow it.""

Despite these limitations, Woods is determined to continue competing at a high level. He spent multiple days hitting full swing shots during the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, a sign that he's still capable of playing at an elite level. Woods plans to compete in a few events per year, akin to golfer Ben Hogan's career after recovering from an auto accident.

Fellow golfer Justin Thomas speculated that Woods would only play if he could perform well, aligning with Woods' current stance. ""I think he's only going to play if he feels like he can contend,"" Thomas said. ""He's not going to play just to play. He's going to play because he thinks he can win.""

Woods' return to competitive golf at the PNC Championship is seen as a significant step in his recovery and adaptation to his limitations. It's a testament to his determination and resilience, and a reminder that even the greatest athletes can overcome adversity and continue to achieve greatness.

As Woods prepares to take the course alongside his son, he's well aware of the challenges that lie ahead. ""I'm not the same player I used to be,"" Woods said. ""I'll never be able to play golf the way I used to. But I'm still able to play golf, and that's all that matters.""

The PNC Championship, which takes place December 17-20, will be Woods' first competitive event since the accident. It's a 36-hole tournament that features 20 teams of two players, with Woods and his son Charlie competing together.

Woods' return to competitive golf is a welcome sight for fans and fellow golfers alike. It's a reminder that even the greatest athletes can overcome adversity and continue to achieve greatness. As Woods takes the course alongside his son, he's not just competing for himself, but for the millions of fans who have followed his career and been inspired by his determination and resilience.

In the words of Woods himself, ""I'm not done yet. I still have a lot of golf left in me."" And with that, the golf world eagerly awaits the return of one of its greatest champions."
392	"San Francisco Police Prepare for Pro-Trump Rally at Twitter HQ

San Francisco police are preparing for a possible pro-Trump rally at Twitter headquarters following the company's suspension of President Trump's account.

There has been social media traffic urging President Trump's supporters to gather at Twitter's headquarters, but there has been no official announcement of a mass demonstration.

Twitter employees have been working remotely since March 2020 due to COVID-19, reducing the number of people at headquarters.

""We respect the right to express views, but we stand by our decision to suspend President Trump's account due to policy violations,"" a Twitter company spokesman said.

San Francisco police have plans in place for the rally, including mutual aid from nearby law enforcement agencies if necessary.

Twitter permanently suspended Mr. Trump's account on Friday, citing the risk of incitement to violence.

The suspension came after Trump supporters forcibly entered the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, resulting in five deaths.

Twitter's decision is part of their effort to enforce rules against glorifying violence.

Other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube also suspended Trump's accounts.

Amazon, Apple, and Google removed the pro-Trump app Parler from their platforms.

Twitter's Decision

Twitter said in a statement that it suspended Mr. Trump's account ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence.""

The company said that Mr. Trump's tweets violated its policy against ""glorifying violence.""

Twitter also said that it had taken into account the ""context of ongoing events"" when making its decision.

Reaction to Twitter's Decision

The decision to suspend Mr. Trump's account has been met with mixed reactions.

Some people have praised Twitter for taking action against Mr. Trump, while others have criticized the company for censorship.

Mr. Trump has called Twitter's decision ""a total disgrace"" and has accused the company of ""silencing"" him.

Impact of Twitter's Decision

Twitter's decision to suspend Mr. Trump's account is likely to have a significant impact on the way that he communicates with his supporters.

Mr. Trump has relied heavily on Twitter to communicate his message, and his suspension from the platform will make it more difficult for him to reach his audience.

It is unclear how Mr. Trump will respond to his suspension from Twitter. He may choose to create an account on another platform, or he may simply stop using social media altogether.

Conclusion

Twitter's decision to suspend Mr. Trump's account is a significant development. It is the first time that a major social media platform has taken such action against a sitting president.

The decision is likely to have a significant impact on the way that Mr. Trump communicates with his supporters. It is also likely to raise questions about the role of social media companies in regulating speech."
2082	"Will the Derek Chauvin conviction for murdering George Floyd change policing?

Before a verdict like the one convicting Chauvin of murder can heal us, another killing rips the band-aid off an open wound. No, I am not just talking about the killing of 20-year-old Duante Wright literally a stone's throw away from where George Floyd was murdered; nor am I talking about 13-year-old Adam Toledo in Chicago. I am actually talking about 15-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant who was killed in Columbus, Ohio almost simultaneously to the time when the Chauvin verdict was being handed down.

Since the start of the Chauvin trial three weeks ago, over 60 people have been killed by police in the United States. Over 1,000 people are killed by police every year. Only half of these killings are actually ruled as justifiable and yet well less than 1% of officers are ever charged or convicted. This has not stopped taxpayers from dishing out billions of dollars in misconduct settlements.

So, while people are viewing Chauvin's murder conviction as an indictment on policing as a whole, this is clearly not the case. The Chauvin verdict was just for one killing. What people actually want is accountability for the entire system. As I mentioned to NBC News, ""In court, individuals are prosecuted... Because of the over individualization of our court system, institutions are let off the hook. The court system magnifies the bad apple narrative.""

Steven Schleicher, who along with fellow prosecutor Jerry Blackwell and the rest of the team assembled by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, was masterful. But even he stated as such during closing arguments. Schleicher stated, ""He (referring to Chauvin) is on trial for what he did, not who he was."" Schleicher was aiming to highlight that Chauvin lost his right to be called a cop. He was also admitting the realization that it is difficult to convict police officers of crimes, especially when a white cop does something to a Black person.

Though the Chauvin trial had all the elements to make this a slam dunk decision, the case was a litmus test on police-community relations and race relations in America. I mean if there was not a conviction in this case, what would it say about how far we still have to go as a nation? There was a myriad of video evidence, numerous in-person witnesses who saw the crime, a slew of officers testifying against Chauvin that his actions were unreasonable, a slew of medical experts, an all-star prosecution team, and a racially-diverse jury. Sadly, it takes this kind of overwhelming evidence in order to convict police officers in America, even officers who have nearly 20 misconduct complaints.

Altogether, the Chauvin trial was an exemplar. However, it remains an outlier and far from the norm of what typically happens when police use unjustifiable force and do not get convicted.

Patrick Yoes, The National President of the Fraternal Order of Police stated on CNN that ""we can go one step closer to getting past this very dark day in American history."" His statement suggests that Chauvin was acting in isolation and not with three other former officers, one of whom pulled a gun on Floyd minutes earlier and another, Chauvin's former partner, who had a series of misconduct complaints. Chauvin was not just a bad apple operating in isolation. Rather, he was part of a rotten tree in policing that allowed him to proliferate."
557	"Suez Canal Blockage: A Wake-Up Call for Fragile Global Supply Chains

The blockage of the Suez Canal by the 1,300-foot-long container ship Ever Given has sent shockwaves through global supply chains, highlighting their fragility and the urgent need for businesses to prepare for disruptions.

The Fragility of Global Supply Chains

""Global supply chains have become increasingly complex and vulnerable,"" said Chris Nicholson, CEO of Pathmind. ""The Suez Canal blockage is a stark reminder of how easily these chains can be disrupted.""

The Suez Canal is a vital artery for global trade, with over 1.2 billion tons of cargo passing through it annually. The blockage has caused significant delays and disruptions for ships carrying everything from oil to consumer goods.

Immediate Crises for Industries

The blockage has had an immediate impact on several industries. Oil prices have jumped as tankers are delayed, and the shortage of computer chips has worsened.

""The Suez Canal blockage is exacerbating the global chip shortage,"" said Lukas Kinigadner, CEO and co-founder of Anyline. ""This will have a ripple effect on industries that rely on chips, such as automotive and electronics.""

The Importance of Crisis Management Plans

Experts emphasize the importance of companies having crisis management plans in place to deal with supply chain disruptions.

""Companies need to be prepared for disruptions and have plans in place to mitigate their impact,"" said Paul Hong, Distinguished University Professor of global supply chain management and Asian studies at The University of Toledo's College of Business and Innovation.

Decision-Making Agility and Team Involvement

""Decision-making agility and team involvement are crucial for navigating crises and finding solutions,"" said David Paulson, global vice president of Avnet. ""Companies need to be able to respond quickly and effectively to changing circumstances.""

Onshoring and Nearshoring

The Suez Canal crisis may push companies towards considering onshoring and nearshoring to reduce supply chain complexity and risks.

""Onshoring and nearshoring can help companies reduce their reliance on long and complex supply chains,"" said Brett Rose, national retail expert and founder and CEO of United National Consumer Suppliers.

Shortages and Shipping Container Shortages

The prolonged blockage of the Suez Canal could lead to shortages of finished goods in Europe and exacerbate shipping container shortages.

""The Suez Canal blockage is a major disruption to global trade,"" said Pierre Subeh, business expert and chief operating officer of marketing technology firm X Network. ""It could lead to shortages of certain goods and further strain the already tight shipping container market.""

Trade Credit Insurance

""Trade credit insurance can protect companies against losses from supply chain disruptions,"" said David Macknin, principal of risk assessment and management firm ChicagoRisk. ""It's an important tool for businesses to consider in today's uncertain environment.""

Conclusion

The Suez Canal blockage is a wake-up call for businesses to address the fragility of global supply chains. By implementing crisis management plans, embracing decision-making agility, and considering onshoring and nearshoring, companies can mitigate the impact of future disruptions and ensure the resilience of their supply chains."
258	"Biden on tour of two states heavily affected by Hurricane Ida

The US President is touring New Jersey and New York after the violent storm devastated the two states with flooding.

President Joe Biden has toured flood damage in New Jersey and says he was thinking about the all families who suffered ""profound"" losses from the powerful remnants of Hurricane Ida.

Biden also planned to visit New York City on Tuesday, to survey the aftermath and call for federal spending to fortify infrastructure to better defend people and property from future storms in the region and far beyond.

He put the blame squarely on climate change.

""Every part of the country is getting hit by extreme weather,"" Biden said in a briefing at the Somerset County emergency management training centre attended by federal, state and local officials, including New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.

""We can't turn it back very much, but we can prevent it from getting worse,"" he said.

Hurricane Ida hit the gulf coast of Louisiana, August 29, as a powerful Category 4 storm, with sustained winds of 240km/h (150mph). It moved across the northeastern states, weakening into a post-tropical cyclone, dumping record rainfall on New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania on September 1 and causing tornadoes.

Biden added that scientists have been warning of the dangers of climate change and that urgent action was needed.

""For decades, scientists have warned of extreme weather that would be more extreme and climate change was here,"" he said, ""and we're living through it now, we don't have any more time.""

Biden has approved major disaster declarations, making federal aid available for people in six New Jersey counties and five New York counties affected by the devastating floods.

Manville, situated along New Jersey's Raritan River, is almost always hard-hit by major storms. It was the scene of catastrophic flooding in 1998 as the remnants of Tropical Storm Floyd swept over New Jersey. It also sustained serious flooding during the aftermath of Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

""I think the country has finally acknowledged the fact that global warming is real and it's moving at an incredible pace and we have to do something about it,"" Biden said.

""This is an opportunity,"" he said."
1502	"FBI Director Wray Debunks Claims of 'Fake Trump Protesters' in Capitol Riot, Refutes Voter Fraud Claims

Washington CNN – FBI Director Chris Wray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, addressing claims that the January 6 Capitol rioters were ""fake Trump protesters"" and refuting widespread voter fraud claims in the 2020 election.

During the testimony, Wray stated that the FBI has found no evidence to support the claim that the rioters were posing as Trump supporters or that Antifa was involved in the violence. ""We have not seen any evidence to suggest that the individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot were anything other than Trump supporters,"" Wray said.

The FBI director also addressed the issue of voter fraud, which has been promoted by President Trump and some of his allies. ""We have not found any evidence to support the claim that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election,"" Wray said. ""Our investigation has shown that the claims of voter fraud are unfounded and baseless.""

Despite debunking these false claims, Wray did not denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon conspiracy theories. When asked by Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) why the FBI had not condemned elected officials who amplify QAnon theories, Wray replied, ""I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the actions of individual lawmakers.""

Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed disappointment over Wray's reluctance to condemn elected officials who promote QAnon theories. ""It's unfortunate that the FBI is not taking a stronger stance against these dangerous conspiracy theories,"" Durbin said.

Wray defended the FBI's sharing of the ""Norfolk memo,"" an intelligence report about potential threats before the Capitol attack. The report was shared with law enforcement agencies, including the Capitol Police, through email, a verbal briefing, and a law enforcement portal. Wray admitted that he did not see the report until after January 6, but mentioned the challenge of sharing intelligence across departments.

The FBI aims to develop better sources for gaining intelligence on domestic extremists, with arrests providing valuable information. ""We are working to improve our sources and methods for identifying and tracking domestic extremists,"" Wray said. ""The arrests of individuals involved in the Capitol riot have provided valuable intelligence that will help us to identify and disrupt future threats.""

Quoting Wray directly:

  • ""We have not seen any evidence to suggest that the individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot were anything other than Trump supporters.""
  • ""We have not found any evidence to support the claim that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.""
  • ""I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the actions of individual lawmakers.""

Quoting Senator Dick Durbin directly:

  • ""It's unfortunate that the FBI is not taking a stronger stance against these dangerous conspiracy theories.""

Quoting Senator Richard Blumenthal directly:

  • ""I am disappointed that the FBI is not taking a stronger stance against lawmakers who endorse QAnon conspiracy theories."""
1092	"Inside Kamala Harris' frustrating start as vice president

CNN — Worn out by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus, key West Wing aides have largely thrown up their hands at Vice President Kamala Harris and her staff – deciding there simply isn't time to deal with them right now, especially at a moment when President Joe Biden faces quickly multiplying legislative and political concerns.

The exasperation runs both ways. Interviews with nearly three dozen former and current Harris aides, administration officials, Democratic operatives, donors and outside advisers – who spoke extensively to CNN – reveal a complex reality inside the White House. Many in the vice president's circle fume that she's not being adequately prepared or positioned, and instead is being sidelined. The vice president herself has told several confidants she feels constrained in what she's able to do politically. And those around her remain wary of even hinting at future political ambitions, with Biden's team highly attuned to signs of disloyalty, particularly from the vice president.

She's a heartbeat away from the presidency now. She could be just a year away from launching a presidential campaign of her own, given doubts throughout the political world that Biden will actually go through with a reelection bid in 2024, something he's pledged to do publicly and privately. Or she'll be a critical validator in three years for a President trying to get the country to reelect him to serve until he's 86.

Few of the insiders who spoke with CNN think she's being well-prepared for whichever role it will be. Harris is struggling with a rocky relationship with some parts of the White House, while long-time supporters feel abandoned and see no coherent public sense of what she's done or been trying to do as vice president. Being the first woman, and first woman of color, in national elected office is historic but has also come with outsized scrutiny and no forgiveness for even small errors, as she'll often point out.

Defenders and people who care for Harris are getting frantic. When they're annoyed, some pass around a recent Onion story mocking her lack of more substantive work, one with the headline, ""White House Urges Kamala Harris To Sit At Computer All Day In Case Emails Come Through.""

380	"Facebook Fails To Shut Down Algorithms Research Program In a desperate attempt to regain control of its algorithm research program, Facebook's CEO admitted in court that the project was in danger of being shut down if it were not stopped immediately.

Starting with a short and fitting headline, the headline could read, ""Facebook Fails To Shut Down Algorithms Research Program: Is Facebook Facing Legal Threats?"". This would highlight the importance of shutting down algorithmic research programs and the reasons why it would fail to comply with the terms of service.

In conclusion, despite Facebook's claims, AlgorithmWatch's algorithm has faced legal threats from Facebook for stealing user data, and despite Facebook's promise not to take any action, the project has suffered significant costs.

From the start, the company has faced legal threats for violating the terms of its privacy policy, and it would be unfair for Facebook to continue to exploit its users for its own gain.

AlgorithmWatch is a self-driving car algorithm developed in Berlin, Germany. AlgorithmWatch was forced to halt its research in May due to legal threats from Facebook.

AlgorithmWatch's solution was to exploit Facebook's privacy policy by sharing sensitive data from its users' feeds. This allowed for Facebook to track algorithmic behavior, allowing it to adjust its algorithm's algorithms to align with Facebook's criteria. This allowed for Facebook to gain control over its algorithm research program, thereby making it less vulnerable to legal threats from Facebook.

AlgorithmWatch is currently operating under the guidance of the Berlin-based social networks, but the company did not formally deny the allegations against them. However, the company's CEO, the CEO of Verge, admitted in court that the data was stolen from the company's privacy policy.

Given the company's clear intentions to protect user data, the legal threats against AlgorithmWatch may not have been immediately apparent. Algorithmic research is a sensitive topic that the company has been working on for some time. Facebook has been actively attempting to engage in algorithmic research programs to improve its algorithms, but this project has come under intense legal threats from the company's privacy policies.

In conclusion, despite Facebook's claims, AlgorithmWatch's algorithmic research program has faced legal threats from Facebook for stealing user data. Despite Facebook's promise to stop collecting user data, AlgorithmWatch has failed to comply with Facebook's privacy policy and its terms of service.

AlgorithmWatch has faced significant costs due to its reliance on social networks and its lack of cooperation from the company. Despite this setback, AlgorithmWatch continues to operate under the guidance of the Berlin-based social networks.

In conclusion, despite the company's clear intentions, AlgorithmWatch's algorithmic research project has faced legal threats due to its lack of cooperation and their lack of trust from the company."

2122	"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) – In a career spanning two decades, Tom Brady has etched his name in the annals of American football with a record seven Super Bowl victories. Remarkably, these triumphs have come with both star-studded casts and teams built on journeymen, defying the conventional wisdom that a quarterback's success depends on elite receivers.

Brady's ability to elevate the play of those around him is well-documented, turning relatively unknown players like Julian Edelman and Wes Welker into household names. ""Tom has always had a knack for making everyone around him better,"" says Troy Brown, Brady's leading receiver in their first Super Bowl victory and now a coach for the Patriots. ""He's a true leader, and that's what sets him apart.""

The quarterback's collaboration with Hall of Famer Randy Moss in 2007 remains a high point, as the pair shattered records but narrowly missed out on a championship. ""When Tom and Randy were on the field, it was like watching poetry in motion,"" reminisces Jermaine Wiggins, a former teammate. ""It's hard to believe he's not still here in New England.""

This weekend, Brady will face his former team, the Patriots, for the first time since his departure after 20 seasons. The game promises to be an emotional affair, with both sides eager to prove their mettle. ""It's going to be competitive, but it's not personal,"" Brown asserts. ""We know what Tom brings to the table, and we respect that.""

Head Coach Bill Belichick acknowledges the significance of Brady's departure, stating, ""Tom made a decision based on what was best for him. It wasn't about us not wanting him."" While details of their parting remain private, Brady has consistently praised Belichick and the Patriots organization, emphasizing that the split was handled with grace.

As Brady prepares to take the field against his former team, his longevity and skill continue to amaze. ""I never thought I'd see the day when Tom wouldn't be in a Patriots uniform,"" Wiggins admits. ""But he's still playing at an elite level, and that's a testament to his dedication.""

Brady, ever the consummate professional, remains focused on the task at hand. ""I'm grateful for my time in New England and the relationships I built there,"" he says. ""But now, it's about going out there and giving my best for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers."""
1706	"Here's How Americans Spent Their Stimulus Checks

Now that most Americans have received a third stimulus check, you may be wondering how people have spent their Economic Impact Payments. Cumulatively, Americans have received more than $850 billion of Economic Impact Payments from three different stimulus packages in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to new research, here's how most Americans have spent their stimulus checks and how stimulus checks have impacted the economy.

How did Americans spend their stimulus checks?

The answer: it depends.

First stimulus check: Cares Act

For the first stimulus check, almost 75% used, or planned to use, their stimulus payments for household expenses. Why? The first stimulus check was mostly disbursed in April 2020 when the unemployment rate was 14.7% and there was greater uncertainty about the Covid-19 pandemic.

Second stimulus check and third stimulus checks

However, the spending patterns changed for the second and third stimulus checks. For example, approximately 20% spent or planned to spend their stimulus checks on essential expenses such as food and housing. Americans instead chose to use their Economic Impact Payments to save for retirement or pay off debt. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, here's how the Americans spend their second stimulus check (Consolidation Appropriations Act) and third stimulus check (American Rescue Plan) compared to the first stimulus check:

First Stimulus Check: Spend (74%), Save (14%), Pay Debt (11%)

Spend (74%), Save (14%), Pay Debt (11%) Second Stimulus Check: Spend (22%), Save (26%), Pay Debt (51%)

Spend (22%), Save (26%), Pay Debt (51%) Third Stimulus Check: Spend (19%), Save (32%), Pay Debt (49%)

How Americans spent their stimulus checks Peter G. Peterson Foundation per The U.S. Census Bureau data

How income level affected stimulus checks

The first, second and third stimulus checks reached an estimated 85% of households. Stimulus payments targeted lower income and middle income households, with a gradual decline for households earning more than $75,000 annually. The amount of an individual's income impacted how they spent their stimulus payment. While all income levels were more likely to spend their first stimulus check, higher income individuals were more likely to save their stimulus check. This is particularly true in the second and third stimulus checks. For example, in comparison to spending on essential expenses, households that earned more than $150,000 annually were more likely to both save their stimulus check and use their stimulus check to pay off debt. Lower income and middle income households, according to the researchers, may have been less willing to save or pay off debt due to uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Have stimulus checks helped the economy?

The research is inconclusive how much stimulus checks have helped the economy. That said, Economic Impact Payments ""may have contributed to a rise in"" personal income, consumer spending, personal savings and economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the stimulus checks under the Cares Act increased economic output in the U.S. by 0.6%. In comparison, enhanced unemploymentt benefits boosted the economy by 1.1%, while the Payment Protection Program (PPP) led to an increase of 0.8%."
55	"Insight: Why Hurricane Ida crippled the New Orleans power grid

Sept 4 (Reuters) - Hurricane Ida's 150-mph winds crippled a Louisiana electric grid already vulnerable from aging transmission lines, electricity bottlenecks and $2 billion worth of damage caused by three hurricanes that hit last year.

Ida's landfall on Sunday left a wake of destruction and suffering. More than 1 million customers were without electricity immediately after the storm - a hardship that, for some, could last weeks.

Entergy Corp (ETR.N) the largest Louisiana utility, is facing tough questions on whether it had done enough to harden the electric system, which lost eight major transmission lines delivering power to the New Orleans metropolitan area.

Entergy was in the midst of upgrades throughout its system after Hurricane Laura in 2020. From 2017 to 2019, Entergy's Louisiana subsidiary spent about $1.2 billion on numerous projects to improve its transmission system.

A pivotal question now for Entergy and its consumers is how well those capital improvements survived the hurricane's wrath compared to the company's older infrastructure. Entergy declined to detail the age of the eight New Orleans-area transmission lines that failed.

""The reason the lights are out is not because we aren't building a resilient system,"" said Rod West, Entergy's group president of utility operations. ""The lights are out because Mother Nature is still the undisputed, undefeated heavyweight champion of the world.""

Hurricane Laura in southwest Louisiana highlighted how Entergy operates a transmission network with two different design standards for resisting wind damage. Transmission lines and infrastructure built in recent years are rated to withstand 140-mph winds, and in some cases up to 150 mph gusts, according to Entergy disclosures with Louisiana utility regulators.

But large sections of Entergy's Louisiana network were designed to withstand wind speeds far below what Ida delivered. About one-sixth of Entergy Louisiana's transmission system, covering about 900 miles, consists of 69-kilovolt lines, the majority of which are only rated at 95 mph, according to Entergy disclosures to regulators.

The 1970s-era design standard, which was used in building part of the network that feeds New Orleans, is a holdover from when Gulf States Utilities operated the transmission system, according to Entergy disclosures to Louisiana regulators.

Many structures on the legacy system were destroyed last year during Hurricane Laura, according to testimony submitted by Entergy executives this year to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The company has asked regulators to approve more than $500 million to repair and rebuild damaged transmission lines from 2020 hurricanes, a cost that would be shouldered by ratepayers in their monthly electric bills.

Three years after Entergy merged with Gulf States in 1994, the company implemented a more robust design for the transmission network that met or exceeded the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) standard. But the network still includes lines built to the older, lower standard because they complied with NESC codes at the time they were constructed.

That leaves the network more vulnerable to outages, said Praveen Malhotra, an engineer and expert on catastrophe risk who has studied hurricane effects on transmission systems.

""The whole system is only as strong as the weakest link,"" Malhotra said.

Entergy said in a statement that much of the damage from Ida was related to the high winds, causing several lines to become detached from their structures. The eight transmission tie lines that were rendered inoperable are vital because they connect the integrated transmission system in the greater New Orleans area to the larger national grid."
300	"Facebook Outage Highlights the Importance of BGP and Internet Infrastructure

On Monday, Facebook, along with other services such as Instagram and WhatsApp, experienced a massive outage that lasted for several hours. Users worldwide were unable to access these platforms, causing widespread disruption. Initially, many pointed to issues with BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) as the culprit. However, further investigation revealed that the outage was primarily the result of a Facebook maintenance error. Nonetheless, the incident sheds light on the significance of BGP and the intricate workings of the internet's infrastructure.

Border Gateway Protocol is a crucial system that directs internet traffic. Much like a map guiding drivers from one location to another, BGP navigates data packets through various autonomous systems, including internet service providers, companies, and governments, ensuring efficient data transfers. Each autonomous system operates independently, making BGP an essential component in maintaining seamless communication across the web.

Errors in BGP can lead to misdirected traffic, similar to outdated or incorrect directions on a map that may mislead drivers. BGP's significance became apparent in the past when ISPs accidentally hijacked traffic or caused global access issues to sites such as YouTube. Despite its critical role, the Facebook outage did not primarily result from external routing issues but instead was traced back to internal communication failures.

Facebook has its own BGP system that facilitates fast updates within its data centers. However, the recent outage was caused by a configuration change on the backbone routers, which resulted in a cascading communication failure between Facebook's data centers. This incident serves as a reminder that the internet's complex infrastructure is dependent on the efficiency and stability of various interconnected components.

DNS (Domain Name System) is another fundamental aspect of the internet's infrastructure, working in tandem with BGP. The DNS identifies the IP address of a specific website or service, while BGP finds the most efficient route to that IP address. Consequently, when users attempted to access Facebook and encountered difficulties, it was primarily due to the inability of data packets to reach the platform's IP address through the most efficient routes.

The Facebook outage was not caused by BGP failures but rather by a maintenance error that took down connections to its data centers. Nevertheless, the incident underscores the need to maintain and safeguard the web's interconnected infrastructure, ensuring seamless communication and access to services for users. As the internet continues to evolve and grow, understanding the role of BGP and other vital components will be crucial in maintaining its functionality and resilience."
1275	"Colonial cyberattack raises a question: Can whole-system shutdowns be avoided?

The decision to take the entire Colonial Pipeline Co. system offline following a cyberattack raises questions about whether the pipeline industry will be able to avoid disruptive whole-system shutdowns in the future.

Cybersecurity and information technology professionals warn that following industry best practices alone may not prevent cyberattacks from infecting the systems that control the nation's vast energy infrastructure. With legacy pipeline assets becoming more connected and ransomware on the rise, attacks that shut down physical infrastructure are becoming more commonplace, they said.

""Now we're seeing five to 10 a year. While that might not seem high, this is one of them, and you have an entire coast shut down for a pipeline,"" said Nicholas Friedman, national managing partner and governance, risk and compliance strategist at enterprise risk management firm Templar Shield Inc.

The event is one of the highest-profile cyberattacks on U.S. energy infrastructure to date. It brought to a halt a major artery that provides the East Coast with nearly half of its fuel and prompted the federal government to convene inter-agency meetings and take emergency measures. The impact on fuel prices and supplies continues to be in flux.

Uncertainty around Colonial shutdown

The exact reason for the shutdown remains unclear. In public statements, Colonial has disclosed that it became aware on May 7 that it was the target of a cyberattack involving ransomware, which holds company data hostage. The company said it ""proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat."" That response stopped all pipeline operations and affected some of Colonial's information technology, or IT, systems, Colonial said.

U.S. national security officials offered additional details during a May 10 White House press briefing. Colonial shut down the system in part to ensure the ransomware would not migrate from IT systems to operational networks, which control physical assets in the field, according to U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies Anne Neuberger. She said she could not disclose whether Colonial detected malware in its operational technology, or OT.

Cybersecurity solutions firm Tripwire Inc. said the Colonial incident appears to be limited to IT functions, but warned that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting industrial companies and utilities because they often have limited visibility into OT devices on their industrial network. ""Here we saw the direct impact of an IT event on OT systems, which reinforces the importance of maintaining visibility of assets across your entire network,"" Tripwire Vice President for Industrial Sales Alex Bagwell said in a May 11 blog post.

Visibility entails creating a picture of the relationship between physical and digital worlds that allows companies to immediately identify which assets are associated with an anomaly once it is detected, according to Leo Simonovich, vice president and global head of industrial cyber and digital security at Siemens Energy AG.

That could in turn allow a more precise response to attacks, he added. Simonovich noted that the Colonial cyberattack has one thing in common with a previous attack that shut a gas pipeline system: Both companies took the blunt approach of shuttering a whole system."

The following is the Jan. 12, 2021 message to U.S. troops from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE JOINT FORCE

The American people have trusted the Armed Forces of the United States to protect them and our Constitution for almost 250 years. As we have done throughout our history, the U.S. military will obey lawful orders from civilian leadership, support civil authorities to protect lives and property, ensure public safety in accordance with the law, and remain fully committed to protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

The violent riot in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 was a direct assault on the U.S. Congress, the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process. We mourn the deaths of the two Capitol policemen and others connected to these unprecedented events.

We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.

As Service Members, we must embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution. Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.

On January 20, 2021, in accordance with the Constitution, confirmed by the states and the courts, and certified by Congress, President-elect Biden will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief."
347	"Police Officer Fatally Injured in Capitol Riot Memorialized

Congressional leaders gathered Wednesday in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda to pay tribute to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after being injured during the siege of the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump on January 6.

Sicknick's remains arrived Tuesday at the Capitol in a solemn ceremony featuring dozens of Capitol Police officers, who stood at attention as his urn was carried up the steps to the Rotunda.

In remarks during a ceremony Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Sicknick a patriot and said he will never be forgotten. ""Each day, when members (of Congress) enter the Capitol, this temple of democracy, we will remember his sacrifice,"" she said.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also spoke, calling Sicknick ""a good, kind man."" Members of the officer's family attended the ceremony.

After their remarks, representatives and senators filed past Sicknick's remains and paid their respects.

Late Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, also paid their respects to the fallen officer, and Capitol Police were given an opportunity to participate in a viewing period overnight.

Later Wednesday, Sicknick's remains will be taken to Arlington National Cemetery for burial.

Pelosi and Schumer announced in a joint statement last week that Sicknick would lie in honor in the Rotunda. They said his heroism on January 6 ""helped save lives, defend the temple of our democracy and ensure that the Congress was not diverted from our duty to the Constitution.""

Thousands of supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol that afternoon as Congress met to confirm Biden's victory in the November election.

Sicnick is only the fifth person to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. Others given that honor were civil rights leader Rosa Parks, televangelist Billy Graham, and Capitol Police officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, who died defending the Capitol building in a shooting attack in 1998."
1503	"NYC Law Department's Computer System Hacked, Operations Hindered

The New York City Law Department has been grappling with a significant cybersecurity breach that has left its computer system inaccessible for approximately three days. The incident, believed to be a targeted hacking attack, has prompted the involvement of the FBI and NYC's Cyber Command office to investigate the matter further.

John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, highlighted that the motives behind the hack are still under scrutiny, with the possibility of a ransom demand not being ruled out by officials. Investigators have already identified the malware responsible for the breach and are actively working to trace it back to the perpetrators.

One concerning factor that has emerged is the use of outdated software within the Law Department's computer systems, including Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2010, which are no longer supported by Microsoft. Prior warnings about vulnerabilities in the system had been issued but were unfortunately not adequately addressed, leaving the department exposed to such attacks.

In light of the hack, Law Department employees are currently unable to access the system remotely or utilize their work emails, significantly hampering day-to-day operations. While efforts to contain the breach have been successful in preventing its spread to other systems, the impact on the Law Department's operations remains severe.

Laura Feyer, a spokeswoman for Mayor de Blasio, emphasized the seriousness of the situation, mentioning that an audit of the Law Department's computer systems was conducted last month, the results of which were not disclosed publicly due to security concerns.

This incident falls within a broader trend of cyberattacks targeting American infrastructure, prompting concerns at the highest levels of government. President Biden is anticipated to address these issues with Russian President Putin, amidst growing concerns over the role of foreign actors in such cyber activities."
1531	"Kyle Rittenhouse Verdict Throws GoFundMe Rules Into Chaos

One of the more unexpected ramifications from the Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty verdict was a response from GoFundMe, the popular site that allows you to raise money for various causes.

In an attempt to clarify the situation around the Rittenhouse case, GoFundMe raised even more questions about their policies and the moral authority that seems to be governing them.

In a lengthy Medium post, GoFundMe detailed its Terms of Service – specifically how, since Rittenhouse was charged with a violent crime, pages that attempted to raise money for him and his legal defense were taken down. Now that he has been found not guilty, however, he can accept those funds.

""If someone is acquitted of those charges, as Rittenhouse was today, a fundraiser started subsequently for their legal defense and other expenses would not violate this policy,"" the GoFundMe post read. ""A fundraiser to pay lawyers, cover legal expenses or to help with ongoing living expenses for a person acquitted of those charges could remain active as long as we determine it is not in violation of any of our other terms and, for example, the purpose is clearly stated and the correct beneficiary is added to the fundraiser.""

The implication, which has been seized upon on Twitter, is that if someone is convicted of a violent crime, then GoFundMe cannot solicit or raise funds for that person. Of course, people are often wrongly convicted, and those same people are the ones most in need of fundraising to pay exorbitant court and legal costs.

In response to the backlash, GoFundMe turned off replies to its tweet on the subject.

""We constantly evaluate and evolve our Terms of Service and consider new factors that keep emerging in today's world,"" the Medium post read. ""We care deeply about human rights and have written terms to address this — we do not allow fundraisers that support hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination; or involves weaponry."" So there's that."
1174	"Oxford High School survivor Phoebe Arthur goes home: 'She is a fighter'

Phoebe Arthur is out of the hospital.

""My sweet baby is HOME ❤️❤️❤️❤️ GOD IS GOOD,"" wrote her mother Sandy Cunningham on a verified GoFundMe page set up to help the 14-year-old Oxford High School gunshot victim.

""OUR COMMUNITY IS AMAZING ❤️ lots of love to you all!""

Phoebe had just been released from Hurley Medical Center in Flint. This means one child remained hospitalized in the Nov. 30 shooting that killed four students and injured seven other people, including a teacher.

A 17-year-old female student was in stable condition at St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital, according to the Oakland County Sheriff's Office in a news release Sunday.

The GoFundMe page for Phoebe was set up by Naomi and Edward Ernest of Manchester Township. The dollars go to her parents.

On the home page, Naomi Ernest, Phoebe's cousin, wrote that the teen had been shot in the chest and neck.

""Thankfully, a friend kept Phoebe out of harm's way, holding her, praying with her, and putting compressions on Phoebe's wounds to stop the bleeding until paramedics could arrive. Phoebe sustained serious injuries that required immediate surgery, after which she was put on a ventilator until stable,"" Ernest wrote on GoFundMe.

""Through it all, her mom says Phoebe 'has been the strongest, bravest, most epic human. She is a fighter.' ""

The fundraiser is intended to help cover expenses related to the trauma, both short-term and long term. All money goes directly to the family. By late Monday, the site had about 1,300 donations totaling $75,258 toward a $100,000 goal.

'Made it through'

Updates on the page have included photos and optimism.

""Phoebe had such a big day and made so many advances towards her recovery,"" Cunningham posted Friday. ""She sat up, made it to a chair, walked, did laps around the ped(iatric) unit. She only had one awful pain breakdown today, those being the moments we don't share. Along with all the doctors, nurses, psychologist ... she made it through a big day.""

Ernest thanked people for the messages of support.

""I feel you all should know that your prayers and rallying around Phoebe is truly making a difference, along with her strength and determination to get better. Peace and love to you all,"" she wrote.

The Free Press has reached out to Ernest to see if she would like to comment further.

Donations on the GoFundMe page ranged from $5 to $2,000. Some left messages on the site and others contributed anonymously. Donor comments came from all over the country and included:

""You are a true warrior,"" from Shannon Gammon.

""Keep fighting — and know you are supported,"" from Anita Banach from Romeo.

""Stay strong Phoebe!! Sending love & prayers to you & your community. Charleston, SC stands with you all!"" from Ashley and Travis Parys.

Lady Gaga, the multihyphenate star known for her bold fashion choices, has revealed that the Schiaparelli Haute Couture dress she wore at President Joe Biden's inauguration is one of her favorite outfits. The dress, which featured in a British Vogue video showcasing 20 of Gaga's most iconic looks, was not only stunning but also bulletproof, as revealed by the star herself.

Choosing Schiaparelli, an Italian designer, was a personal choice for Gaga, reflecting her Italian-American heritage. The dress was a beautiful design featuring a giant gilded brooch in the shape of a dove, symbolizing peace. Daniel Roseberry, the current creative director of Maison Schiaparelli, described the ensemble as a love letter to America, celebrating Gaga's artistry.

Gaga's fashion choices for the inauguration did not stop at the Schiaparelli dress. She also wore a white cape by Givenchy before the inauguration, which fans likened to Princess Leia. For the singing performance, Gaga's outfit included a fitted navy cashmere jacket and a voluminous washed red silk faille skirt. Her hair was styled in a braid, similar to the previous day, but accented with a red flower.

Roseberry, who is American, ties the French brand Schiaparelli back to the U.S. with his background. He expressed that the ensemble was a celebration of Gaga's artistry and a representation of the peace and unity that the inauguration symbolized. Lady Gaga's fashion choices have always been a statement, and her inauguration looks were no exception. She proved that fashion can be both a form of self-expression and a symbol of hope and unity."
102	"Special Lockdown Locks Credited with Saving Lives During Oxford High School Shooting

Oxford, Michigan - In the wake of the tragic shooting spree that occurred at Oxford High School last week, attention has turned to the special lockdown locks installed at the school four years ago, which are believed to have saved lives during the incident.

The locks, designed by Nightlock, a company based in Mt. Morris, Michigan, have been sold to approximately 10,000 school districts nationwide. The locking device features a red handle that can be inserted into the door from a wall-mounted box, preventing entry. The locks are designed to keep doors secured even if the glass is broken and someone tries to unlock the door from the outside.

Oxford High School installed a variety of these locks in 2017, suitable for both inward and outward swinging doors. According to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, the alleged shooter did not enter any classrooms, with all casualties occurring in the hallways.

""The fact that the shooter was unable to enter any classrooms was due in large part to the lockdown locks that were installed,"" Sheriff Bouchard said. ""These locks prevented the shooter from gaining access to areas where there were large concentrations of students, which undoubtedly saved lives.""

Cris Ahearn, Director of Sales at Nightlock, expressed emotional distress over the incident but acknowledged the limitations of locking devices in protecting individuals in hallways.

""Our hearts go out to the victims and their families,"" Ahearn said. ""While our locks can help to secure classrooms and prevent entry, they cannot protect individuals who are in the hallways. We are committed to working with schools to find additional ways to enhance safety and security.""

In the aftermath of the shooting, Nightlock has experienced increased inquiries from districts seeking to enhance facility security. The company, which was initially inspired by a home invasion at the owners' parents' house, shifted its focus to developing school security devices after the Sandy Hook shooting.

""We never imagined that our products would be used in a situation like this,"" Ahearn said. ""But we are grateful that they were able to make a difference and save lives.""

Conclusion:

The special lockdown locks installed at Oxford High School four years ago are believed to have saved lives during the recent shooting spree. These locks, along with other safety measures implemented by the school, helped to prevent the shooter from entering classrooms and causing further harm."
559	"ISIS-K's Guerrilla Attacks Test Taliban Rule in Afghanistan, Raising Fears of Instability

Sept 23 (Reuters) – The Islamic State in Khorasan (ISIS-K) has intensified its campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, employing guerrilla tactics reminiscent of those once used by the new rulers themselves. The group's recent attacks, including a devastating assault on Kabul airport and a series of bomb blasts in Jalalabad, have underscored the persistent threat to stability despite the Taliban's control.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid downplayed the ISIS-K threat, telling Reuters, ""We are aware of their activities, but they are not a major concern for us."" However, some Taliban commanders privately express worry about the group's tactics, particularly the use of sticky bombs, which have caused civilian casualties and sown fear in the population.

Since its peak around 2018, ISIS-K has faced losses at the hands of both Taliban and U.S. forces, leading to a decline in its operations. Despite this, Taliban security forces have recently claimed to have killed three ISIS-K members, highlighting the ongoing conflict between the two extremist groups.

Professor Rohan Gunaratna, a security studies expert at Nanyang Technological University, warned that the Taliban's return to power could provide a boost to extremist outfits like ISIS-K and al Qaeda. ""The Taliban's victory could invigorate jihadist groups globally,"" he said. ""ISIS-K, in particular, may attempt to capitalize on any dissatisfaction within the Taliban ranks.""

Estimates place ISIS-K's strength at under 2,000 fighters, a fraction of the Taliban's forces. However, the group has managed to recruit former Taliban members and fighters from the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), bolstering its ranks. According to a United Nations report, internal divisions within the Taliban could lead to defections to ISIS-K, potentially strengthening the group.

Financial and logistical support from ISIS-K's parent organization in Syria is believed to have dwindled, forcing the Afghan affiliate to rely more on local resources and alliances. This situation has constrained the group's expansion but has not eliminated its capacity for violence.

The UN report also points to ISIS-K's exploitation of ungoverned spaces and weak border security to establish cross-border networks, particularly with Pakistan. This has allowed the group to maintain a degree of resilience despite the challenges it faces.

As Afghanistan navigates its new reality under Taliban rule, the specter of ISIS-K and other extremist groups looms large. The ability of the Taliban to effectively counter these threats will be a crucial test of their capacity to govern and ensure stability in the war-torn nation."

1773	"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Donate Diapers to a Charity in L.A.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex love to surprise those in need with donations. Today, the pair gave an unexpected large gift to Harvest Home, a Los Angeles charity supporting homeless pregnant women. The Harvest Home team walked outside their Pico-Robertson location to find boxes upon boxes of diapers.

The donation was made in a collaboration between Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, their charitable foundation, Archewell, and companies Procter & Gamble and Pampers. Harvest Home posted about the surprise gift on their Instagram account, alongside a photo of the many diapers.

""Pallets and pallets of diapers ...we are so grateful! 🤍,"" the organization wrote. ""These diapers recently arrived at our new Pico-Robertson Home and we could not be more thankful to the Archewell Foundation, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and @proctergamble and @pampersus for the incredible donation through their Million Acts of Love Campaign. Thank you helping us ensure that our moms and babies have all they need in our homes!""

The Duke and Duchess became involved with Harvest Home when they moved to California. On Mother's Day this May, the pair made another surprise donation to the charity through the Archewell Foundation, the charitable arm of their Archewell media and nonprofit organization. The couple made the gift while Meghan was pregnant with their daughter, Lilibet, adding further salience to the cause. After making that donation, Meghan released a statement explaining why she chooses to support Harvest Home.

Read the Duchess of Sussex's full statement about Harvest Home here:

As a mom, and an expectant mom, I deeply appreciate the significance of community support, safe and accessible pregnancy resources, and trusted guidance in a nurturing setting. These ingredients are essential to not just our physical health, but our mental well-being, and I commend you for leading a compassionate community that lives these values.

Thank you for all you do for the women and mothers who are turned away elsewhere, at no fault of their own. When we consider how vulnerable any mother feels during the fragile time of pregnancy, we gain perspective about how especially difficult it can be for pregnant women of color and those who come from under-resourced and vulnerable communities. I hope you will accept an offer of support to help further uplift Harvest Home's residents."

Results from a Phase 3 clinical trial enrolling 29,960 adult volunteers in the United States and Mexico show that the investigational vaccine known as NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated 90.4% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease. The candidate showed 100% protection against moderate and severe disease. In people at high risk of developing complications from COVID-19 (people 65 years or older and people under age 65 with certain comorbidities or with likely regular exposure to COVID-19), the vaccine showed 91.0% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease.

Safety data indicate the investigational vaccine was generally well-tolerated. Mild-to-moderate injection site pain and tenderness were the most common local symptoms among participants, and fatigue, headache and muscle pain lasting less than two days were the most common systemic symptoms.

Novavax, Inc., of Gaithersburg, Maryland, developed the investigational vaccine and led the clinical trial known as PREVENT-19. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, provided funding support for the trial as part of the federal COVID-19 response.

The PREVENT-19 trial began in late December 2020 and enrolled adult volunteers at 119 study sites, including those in the NIAID-supported COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN). Participants were randomly assigned to receive two shots, 21 days apart, of either the investigational vaccine or a saline placebo. Randomization occurred in a 2:1 ratio with two volunteers receiving NVX-CoV2373 for each one who received placebo. Because the trial was blinded, neither investigators nor participants knew who received the candidate vaccine.

PREVENT-19 was designed to evaluate whether NVX-CoV2373 can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease seven or more days after the second injection relative to placebo. The results shared today are based on 77 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 that investigators observed among trial participants from January 25 through April 30, 2021. Investigators recorded 63 cases among the approximately 10,000 participants who received placebo and 14 cases among the approximately 20,000 participants who received the investigational vaccine. Of the 63 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group, investigators classified 10 as moderate and four as severe. There were no cases of moderate or severe disease in the investigational vaccine group."
2158	"Capitol rioter ""horrendously smitten"" by Trump willing to speak at impeachment trial, lawyer says

The lawyer for an Arizona man who took part in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol while sporting face paint, no shirt and a furry hat with horns is offering to have his client, Jacob Chansley, testify at former President Donald Trump's upcoming impeachment trial. Lawyer Albert Watkins said it's important for senators to hear the voice of someone who was incited by Mr. Trump.

Watkins said his client was previously ""horrendously smitten"" by Mr. Trump but now feels let down after Mr. Trump's refusal to grant Chansley and others who participated in the insurrection a pardon. ""He felt like he was betrayed by the president,"" Watkins said.

Watkins said he hasn't spoken to any member in the Senate since announcing his offer to have Chansley — also known as Jake Angeli — testify at the trial, which is scheduled to begin the week of February 8.

The words of Trump supporters who are accused of participating in the riot may end up being used against him in his impeachment trial. Chansley and at least four others people who are facing federal charges stemming from the riot have suggested they were taking orders from the now-former president.

Chansley, who calls himself the ""QAnon Shaman"" and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, hasn't yet entered a plea to charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, disorderly conduct in a restricted building, demonstrating in a Capitol building and other counts. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Washington.

In successfully seeking his detention until trial, prosecutors said Chansley went into the Capitol carrying a U.S. flag attached to a wooden pole topped with a spear and ignored an officer's commands to leave. Prosecutors said Chansley entered the Senate chamber with a group of about 25 rioters, posed for pictures at the dais where then-Vice President Mike Pence had been minutes before, and left a note that read, ""It's only a matter of time. Justice is coming.""

The following day, prosecutors say Chansley called the FBI Washington field office, admitted his involvement and described Pence as a ""child-trafficking traitor,"" but said he did not intend the note to be a threat. When asked about the meaning of the note, he launched into a ""lengthy diatribe"" describing current and past lawmakers including Pence, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden as ""infiltrators involved in various types of wrongdoing.""

Chansley told investigators he came to the Capitol ""at the request of the president that all 'patriots' come to D.C. on January 6,"" according to court records."
1679	"Gabby Petito Case Sparks Appeal Over Unsolved Disappearance of Arizona Man

The discovery of a body believed to be that of 22-year-old Gabby Petito has prompted fresh appeals for help in locating missing man Daniel Robinson.

On Sunday the FBI confirmed that human remains consistent with a description of Petito were discovered in the Spread Creek area of Wyoming.

In the wake of the discovery, Shayla Davis took to Twitter to shine a light on Robinson's disappearance.

""I'm shaking reading about the discovery of Gabby Petito's body in Wyoming,"" she wrote. ""While we're watching this case unfold, please take 5 seconds to read about Daniel Robinson, a geologist who went missing in the desert outside Buckeye three months ago. His father is still looking for him.""

Davis' post has garnered more than 20,000 retweets and has been liked over 38,000 times, prompting renewed interest in Daniel's case.

Daniel was reported missing on June 23.

He was last seen earlier that day leaving a job site near Sun Valley Parkway and Cactus Road in his 2017 blue Jeep Renegade with the license plate NLA2CMA.

A field geologist who moved to Phoenix for his work, Daniel regularly worked on sites in remote desert locations, often in extreme conditions.

He is described as 5-foot-8 with black hair and brown eyes and does not have a right forearm or hand.

According to the Buckeye Police Department, Daniel did not tell anyone on site where he was going or why he was leaving.

On July 19, his Jeep was discovered near a ravine close to where he was last seen. The vehicle had sustained significant damage. The airbags had been deployed and initial evidence indicated the driver had been wearing a seat belt.

Several of Daniel's personal effects including clothes, a cellphone, wallet and keys were also found in the vehicle.

Later that month, on July 31, a human skull was found in an area south of where the Jeep was found, however subsequent tests determined that it was not Daniel's.

Investigators have ruled out the possibility of foul play due to the damage sustained by Daniel's car.

His father, David Robinson II, has traveled from his home in South Carolina to continue the search for answers and has set up a GoFundMe page to pay for a private investigator along with flyers, continued searches and other expenses.

""Daniel has an innate passion for adventure and is known to travel inopportune moments,"" a statement on the GoFundMe page reads. ""However, he always communicates with friends and family about his travel plans.""

More than $34,000 has been raised so far with David pledging to stay on ""indefinitely until we have answers and bring Daniel home safely.""

The fundraiser has been set up because ""the current investigation by law enforcement is not progressing.""

According to WIS, private investigator Jeff McGrath has been hired to look into the disappearance and has uncovered several potentially key details.

652	"Facebook and Google are failing to crack down on scam ads, new research suggests

Facebook and Google are failing to crack down on fraudulent ads placed on their platforms, even after users have reported them, new research shows.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Online fraud has skyrocketed over the past year, as scammers capitalized on the widespread lockdowns that have kept people indoors all over the world.

Tech giants have come under pressure to take action against nefarious actors with past reports accusing Facebook of having a ""lax approach"" to the issue, while criminals continue to set up fake Google ads in a matter of hours.

More than a third (34%) of people that reported a scam ad to Google said it was not taken down while just over a quarter (26%) said the same had happened with Facebook, according to a study published by British consumer group Which?.

Which gave examples of scammers posting fake ads for discounts at established shoe retailers like Clarks or Russell and Bromley, using their logos and branding. These ads lead to look-a-like websites that steal consumers' financial details. One victim said she paid £85 for a pair of boots, but instead received a pair of cheap sunglasses.

Scammers post convincing fake ads for brands, such as shoe retailer Clarks. Which?

The study, of 2,000 adults in the UK, found that while Google was worse at reacting to reported scams, victims were more likely to encounter a fraudulent ad on Facebook in the first place.

Around 27% said they had come up against a scam ad on Facebook compared to 19% on Google.

Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said the findings showed both Facebook and Google had left their users ""worryingly exposed to scams,"" and suggested the UK government bring in legislation to root out the problem.

""Online platforms must be given a legal responsibility to identify, remove and prevent fake and fraudulent content on their sites,"" he said. ""The case for including scams in the Online Safety Bill is overwhelming and the government needs to act now.""

As part of the British government's proposed Online Safety Bill, tech companies that allow users to post their own material or talk to others online could be fined up to £18 million (around $25 million) or 10% of their annual revenue, whichever is higher, for failing to remove ""harmful"" content.

The Bill is expected to contain extra provisions for the biggest social media companies with ""high-risk features,"" expected to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.

A Facebook spokesperson told Insider fraudulent activity was ""not allowed"" on its platform, adding that the company had taken action against a number of the scam pages reported.

""Our 35,000 strong team of safety and security experts work alongside sophisticated AI to proactively identify and remove this content, and we urge people to report any suspicious activity to us,"" they said.

A Google spokesperson said the company had previously removed more than 3.1 billion scam ads for violating its policies. ""We take action on potentially bad ads reported to us and these complaints are always manually reviewed,"" they said."
1313	"America on Trial: Racial Injustice and the Legacy of White Vigilantism

The recent acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse and the conviction of the men responsible for Ahmaud Arbery's death have brought to the forefront a riveting national discourse on white vigilantism and racial injustice within the United States. These trials, emblematic of divergent legal outcomes, have exposed the intricate web of self-defense claims and racial dynamics in the courtroom, prompting society to confront whom these laws truly protect and at whose expense they are enforced.

Carol Anderson, a historian and professor of African American studies at Emory University, critically assesses the protection bestowed upon white individuals or property as a persistent theme in America's sordid racial history. ""It is a centuries-old narrative that is rooted deep in the soil of America, where the protection of white rights systematically overshadows that of minorities,"" Anderson states, highlighting a troubling tradition of inequality.

Both Rittenhouse's acquittal and the trial of Arbery's killers are symptomatic of a broader gun culture and legislations that seemingly enable white men to act with violent impunity, often cloaked in the guise of self-defense. This scenario paints a stark portrait of the racial rifts that permeate American society, further exacerbated by widespread protests for racial justice and the tumultuous insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Michael Waldman, President of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law, ties these events to a historical continuum of efforts to control Black populations through laws and societal norms that unjustly favor white autonomy. ""This isn't new. The underpinning racism intertwined with gun culture and self-defense laws has propelled white vigilantism through centuries,"" Waldman remarks.

Darryl Pinckney, a distinguished writer, draws attention to the historical violence and vilification faced by white allies of Black liberation, both past and present. ""Being a white ally has always come with risks, showing that the issue is less about race and more about perpetuating a system of power and control,"" he explains.

Angela Onwuachi-Willig, Dean of Boston University's law school, and Ashley Howard, an assistant professor of African American history at the University of Iowa, both emphasize the continuity in the danger Black Americans face in predominantly white spaces. Howard states, ""The echoes of historical racial violence are loud and clear today, as Black Americans navigate spaces where their presence is deemed suspect or threatening by virtue of their race alone.""

Onwuachi-Willig links current racial dynamics to a palpable fear among some white individuals of a diminishing identity and power base. ""In the wake of a broad movement for racial equality, there's a reactionary element that perceives equality as a threat to white supremacy,"" she asserts.

As America grapples with its complex legacy of racial injustice and white vigilantism, these trials stand not as isolated incidents but as reflections of deeply entrenched societal divisions. They challenge us to confront uncomfortable truths about our history and present, urging a reexamination of justice and equity in the fabric of American society."
570	"Blocked Suez Canal Is Latest Reminder Why Companies Need Crisis Plans

These are tough times for supply chains and business leaders who depend on them. Brexit. The pandemic. Congestion at major ports. Now a 1,300-foot-long container ship is preventing hundreds of other vessels from using the Suez Canal, one of the most important waterways in the world.

If corporate officials needed to be reminded about the importance of preparing or updating their crisis management plans in these uncertain times, the headlines about the stranded ship should be enough to make their plans a top priority—whether they rely on supply chains or not.

Company executives who don't know today how they would respond to a crisis tomorrow could make a bad situation worse when hit with a crisis, and harder to address and recover from it.

Fragile Situation

To the untrained eye, supply chains can appear to be strong, dependable, and built on a solid foundation. But as the Suez Canal crisis shows, looks are deceiving.

Chris Nicholson is the CEO of Pathmind, which uses AI to help companies optimize supply chains. He observed the global supply chain has been built ""..."" on top of ice shavings and toothpicks. There are weak points everywhere. Suez isn't the only one.

""A lot of companies outsource different parts of their supply chain to be managed by others, which makes them passive consumers of other peoples' mistakes. They don't have the ability to react. They don't know what their alternatives are.""

He noted that, ""There are cheap manufacturers on different continents, but you pay the price in the complexity of your supply chain. It is a hidden price until Suez happen[ed], and then it is not hidden anymore.""

Nicholson predicted the current canal blockage, "".... and other events are going to push companies to look at more alternatives like onshoring and nearshoring, which will coincide with Biden's policies to recenter the U.S. supply chain in North America.""

Sudden Impact

It did not take long for the stranded ship to create crisis situations for others.

Lukas Kinigadner is the CEO and co-founder of Anyline, a mobile data company. ""Our supply chains are the arteries of industry, and in the era of same-day delivery and 'just-in-time' inventory, even a small blockage can cause headaches and disruptions down the line,"" he observed.

The delays caused by the blockage of the Suez Canal,"" ... are already mounting, with oil prices already jumping, while car and computer manufacturers have raised the alarm over a worsening shortage of computer chips,"" Kinigadner said."
453	"Sheriff executes search warrant for black box from Tiger Woods' crashed car

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has executed a search warrant to obtain data from the ""black box"" in the car that was crashed last week by famed golfer Tiger Woods, sheriff's personnel confirmed Tuesday to USA TODAY Sports.

But the sheriff's department has decided not to seek a warrant to obtain Woods' blood to help determine whether he was under the influence of medication at the time of the crash Feb. 23.

To obtain such a warrant for the black box, law enforcement is required to establish there was probable cause that a crime was committed, even if it's just a misdemeanor.

A sheriff's deputy Tuesday downplayed the warrant as a routine part of their probe. He said he didn't consider it a criminal investigation, but rather due diligence. The affidavit that the sheriff's department used to establish such probable cause was not immediately available.

""We're trying to determine if a crime was committed,"" Sheriff's Deputy John Schloegl told USA TODAY Sports Tuesday. ""If somebody is involved in a traffic collision, we've got to reconstruct the traffic collision, if there was any reckless driving, if somebody was on their cell phone or something like that. We determine if there was a crime. If there was no crime, we close out the case, and it was a regular traffic collision.""

Schloegl also said there was ""no probable cause"" to get a warrant to obtain Woods' blood from him or the hospital he went to with broken bones in his lower right leg after the crash.

He added that the Woods camp has been cooperative. Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately return an email seeking comment on Tuesday night.

In 2017, Woods was found asleep at the wheel in Florida and had numerous medications in his system including the sleep aid Ambien, Vicodin, Xanax, Dilaudid and THC, according to the toxicology report that came out later. In January, he announced he had recently undergone the latest of several surgical procedures on his back.

""We can't just assume that somebody's history makes them guilty,"" Schloegl said. He noted that first responders observed Woods to be alert with no evidence of impairment after he crashed his vehicle, a Genesis GV80, while headed north near Rolling Hills Estates in Los Angeles County.

1752	"Human remains found in Wyoming are 'consistent' with description of Gabby Petito, FBI says

Human remains discovered in Teton County, Wyoming, on Sunday are ""consistent with the description of"" missing 22-year-old Gabby Petito, FBI officials said in a news conference.

""Full forensic identification has not been completed to confirm 100% that we found Gabby, but her family has been notified of this discovery,"" said Charles Jones, FBI Denver's supervisory senior resident agent in Wyoming.

The cause of death has not been determined, he said.

Authorities this weekend conducted a search around the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping Area in Bridger-Teton National Forest on the eastern edge of Grand Teton National Park for any sign of Petito, whose family reported her missing September 11.

At the same time, authorities in Florida were looking for Petito's fiancé, Brian Laundrie. His family told police Friday they had not seen Laundrie since last Tuesday, prompting a search of a local nature reserve that has so far yielded no results.

Prior to Petito's disappearance, the couple had been traveling on a road trip through several Western states.

Laundrie returned to North Port, Florida, without Petito on September 1, according to police. Officials later found the van the couple had been traveling in at the home Petito shared with Laundrie and his parents in North Port, a city in Sarasota County some 80 miles south of Tampa.

Laundrie is not wanted for a crime, officials have said. This weekend, dozens of officers and FBI agents combed an area that stretches out to roughly 25,000 acres, according to the North Port Police Department. But the search was suspended for a second time Sunday evening, police said on Twitter, adding, ""Nothing to report.""

Laundrie's family told police he left home with his backpack Tuesday and told them he was going to the reserve, North Port police spokesperson Josh Taylor said Saturday.

Police visited the Laundrie family home after Petito was reported missing, but Laundrie's family refused to talk, Taylor said last week, and instead gave authorities the information for their attorney.

The home was searched Friday evening after Laundrie's family told police they had not seen him for days. Laundrie family attorney Steven Bertolino said Friday that Laundrie's whereabouts ""are currently unknown.""

But Richard Stafford, an attorney for the Petito family, said in a brief statement to CNN, ""All of Gabby's family want the world to know that Brian is not missing, he is hiding. Gabby is missing.""

Jones, the FBI agent, opened Sunday's news conference at Grand Teton National Park by extending condolences to Petito's family.

""As every parent can imagine, this is an incredibly difficult time for the family and friends,"" Jones said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with them.""

Laundrie search continues in 'vast' nature reserve

This weekend, federal and local authorities conducted their search for Laundrie in the ""vast"" Carlton Reserve in Sarasota County, Florida, police said."
301	"NYC Law Department system still down three days after hack uncovered

The city Law Department's computer system remained down Tuesday, about three days after investigators discovered the agency had been hacked.

The FBI and members of the city's Cyber Command office are doing a forensic analysis of the incident and trying to suss out a motive for the attack, which was first reported by the Daily News.

The hackers have yet to demand a ransom, according to de Blasio, but a top NYPD official didn't rule out the possibility down the road.

""Is it someone looking to corral information, export it and then do a ransomware attack? That's a possibility,"" John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a Tuesday press conference alongside the mayor.

New York City counter-terrorism and intelligence deputy commissioner John Miller.

""Is it another kind of actor looking to gather information for other strategic purposes? That's a possibility,"" he added.

Miller said investigators have identified the kind of malware that was used, noting ""we've seen it before,"" and are now trying to trace it back to the hackers.

The Law Department has been using outdated software, two sources with knowledge of the situation told The News.

Some agency computers have been running on the Windows 7 operating system — which Microsoft hasn't supported since January 2020 — the sources said. They also use Microsoft Office 2010, which the company doesn't support, either, they added.

The city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications had been warning the Law Department about the issue prior to the hack, according to one of the sources, an employee with the Law Department's IT division.

""They also send a weekly report with a list of servers and computers that have vulnerabilities and should be addressed,"" the source said.

Another Law Department staffer said the agency ""is very archaic with a lot of things — not just in terms of how they handle tech, but in how they get things done.

""They put a lot of things on the back burner,"" they added. ""It moves slow. They only try to remedy situations after something bad has happened."""

1688	"Colin Powell's funeral was a missed opportunity for the country

On Friday, Gen. Colin Powell's funeral at Washington National Cathedral marked a moment of collective mourning in a deeply divided United States. Powell died on Oct. 18 at 84 from complications of covid-19, to which he was especially susceptible despite vaccination because of cancer and Parkinson's disease. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But, probably because of his and his family's wishes, Powell did not receive a state funeral, and his body did not lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. His service, although televised, was ""private"" and limited only to those invited. President Biden attended but did not speak.

This format muted some of the debates over Powell's legacy, particularly over the second Iraq War. But it also deprived the public of a chance to come together amid deep fractures centered around covid and debates over racism in America. When marked collectively, the passing of public figures has long allowed Americans to ponder their shared national values.

Powell — the son of poor Jamaican immigrants who rose to become a four-star general in the U.S. Army, the youngest and first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as becoming the first Black Secretary of State under George W. Bush — is exactly the kind of figure to receive a ceremonial public funeral in the United States: a respected military leader and leading statesman with bonds across party lines.

National public mourning ceremonies date to Americans holding funeral processions all over the country after George Washington's death in 1799. Washington was not, as Congress hoped, buried beneath the U.S. Capitol, but the spontaneous mourning ceremonies, church services and commemorations (including pamphlets, embroidery and monuments) provided Americans an opportunity to join together in his honor. In the midst of the country's first era of rancorous partisan division, mourning the nation's first president struck a common note of patriotism, even among many who had bitterly opposed Washington himself as president and who reviled John Adams, his successor.

Beginning with Sen. Henry Clay in 1852, presidents, members of Congress and Cabinet leaders periodically have lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Since 1865, many of those accorded this honor have lain atop a catafalque (platform) used to hold the coffin of Abraham Lincoln at the Capitol. After Lincoln lay in state, his body was transported to Illinois for burial, attended by throngs of public mourners and days of funeral rituals along the route.

Such public funerals are designed to celebrate both the dead and the American nation itself, and funerals have provided different Americans with a chance to imagine their connections to one another. No public funeral ever achieves perfect unity, but they all provide opportunities to imagine what American unity could look like, even when the visions differ.

For example, in 1874, when Sen. Charles Sumner (R-Mass.), a most hated enemy of slaveholding Southerners, died in office, he was surprisingly eulogized by Sen. Lucius Q.C. Lamar (D), a former Confederate from Mississippi, who used the occasion to try to dramatize a vision of sectional reconciliation. The former abolitionist Frederick Douglass also eulogized Sumner, but he argued that Sumner's work for Black equality must continue even if it risked keeping some White southerners alienated.

When Douglass died in 1895, members of Congress moved to have his body honored in the Rotunda, but the speaker of the House and Southern senators blocked the motions, and Douglass's huge Washington funeral took place at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church instead. The refusal to have Douglass lie in state pointed to how official public mourning rituals were reserved for White men in the 19th century."

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - New threats against a Colorado Springs middle and elementary school has been deemed uncredible, but the district continues to take every precaution, a spokesperson for Academy District 20 said.

Chinook Trail Middle School was already the subject one disproven threat over the weekend, according to spokesperson Allison Cortez.

""Although that situation was remedied yesterday, overnight new social media threats popped up, this time impacting both Chinook Trail Middle School and Elementary,"" Cortez said in an email to media.

The schools share a campus on the northeast side of Colorado Springs.

The district learned of the new threats Tuesday night and immediately contacted the Colorado Springs Police Department. According to a letter sent to parents and shared with 11 News, police have identified the students involved and do not believe there is any legitimate threat against the schools. Both schools are open Wednesday, but the district said parents may keep their children home if they prefer.

Cortez told 11 News the number of school threats had ticked up in recent days following the shooting at a Michigan high school. None of the local threats were found to be credible.

""The events that happened in Michigan last week have definitely put everyone in our region at high alert. Every time we see a national case like this happen, we start to experience the same thing here locally.""

Cortez said every rumored threat is taken seriously by school districts and local law enforcement.

""Our schools are one of the safest places that you can be. We have security teams, SROs [school resource officers], and we work closely with CSPD when we are aware of threats like this. We have protocols in place like logins, lockouts, secure parameters to keep our students safe and it's our number one priority. Even when it's not credible, we still bring in increase security onto that campus because we know that that's going to make our students feel safer when they integrate back in after a rumor like this has happened.""

Below is the letter sent to families of Chinook Middle and Elementary students:

""Dear Chinook Trail Families,

Yesterday Chinook Trail Middle School dealt with a report of a potential threat against the school made via social media. While this situation was remedied and deemed non-credible, unfortunately, last night we learned of additional social media threats.

Thankfully, many parents reached out and informed us of these incidents and their concerns. Thank you for your assistance.

Last night, we worked with Academy District 20 (ASD20) Security and the Colorado Springs Police Department (CSPD). All rumored threats are being investigated by CSPD. We have identified the students involved and at this point, CSPD has deemed all threats non-credible. We will work with the parents of those involved, CSPD, and utilize district policy to issue appropriate consequences."
275	"Would the Saints have won the Super Bowl if Tom Brady signed in New Orleans?

Drew Brees, New Orleans and NFL legend, sure-fire Hall of Famer, decided to come back for one last rodeo with the Saints in 2020 to chase that elusive second Super Bowl. But what could have happened if he called it a career after the 2019 season?

The Saints were always going to stick with Brees if he decided to run it back. If Brees would return it was going to be in a Saints uniform or no uniform at all. And that's what ended up happening. An injury-plagued year season for Brees consisted of a torn rotator cuff, torn fascia, 11 broken ribs, and a collapsed lung, that only held him out four weeks. Brees recently said at a local golf tournament this summer that the only game he was feeling 100% healthy for was against the Detroit Lions. If Brees was healthy, there is no doubt the season could have looked a lot different, but at the end of the day, he was not.

So what could have happened if Brees stepped away and started his announcing career with NBC one season early. First off, who would have started at QB for New Orleans in 2020? A source inside the Saints building said that Tom Brady had a major interest in New Orleans if in fact Brees had retired.

ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington said on ""Get Up"" this Tuesday, ""I think that people still underestimate how close Tom Brady was to signing with the New Orleans Saints up until he ultimately decided on the Bucs,"" Darlington said. ""I know that that's gonna be a statement people try to question. It's the truth.""

.@JeffDarlington takes a look at Tom Brady's comments about being snubbed by teams in free agency

Brady was keeping close tabs on New Orleans, but other teams such as the Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angels Chargers were in the race but pulled out late. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers since Day 1 were committed on Brady and once Brees said he was returning, Brady signed with the Buccaneers. Recently on the HBO show The Shop: Uninterrupted, Brady said ""You're sticking with that motherf–ker?"" - talking about a team choosing their current starter over him. It is unclear who that team was, but it's unlikely he was referring to New Orleans."

832	"An incomplete Supreme Court witnessed Biden's oath. There's history there.

Only six of the nine members of the Supreme Court attended President Biden's swearing-in Wednesday, the first time in more than 20 years that not all of the justices witnessed the ceremony. Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr., the court's three oldest, were the no-shows. ""Several of the justices elected not to attend the inauguration ceremony in light of the public health risks posed by the COVID pandemic,"" Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement.

The justices have not conducted business in person since March — holding private conferences and oral arguments via teleconference — although they gathered at a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., for the fourth time, administered the oath of office to the president-elect. But he has yet to see a supporter on the other side of the Bible.

President Barack Obama, whom Roberts swore in twice, voted against his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005. So did Biden. And President Donald Trump, to whom Roberts administered the oath in 2017, made clear during the campaign that he considered Roberts a ""disaster.""

The relationship during that presidency was a rocky one, and the chief justice had the chore of presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.

But the theme of Biden's inaugural address was putting differences aside, and the new president may have warmer thoughts these days for Roberts, who turns 66 next week. Roberts was the deciding vote to save Obamacare, the chief domestic accomplishment of the Obama-Biden administration.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina on the Supreme Court, swore in Vice President Harris, the first woman to hold the job. Sotomayor did the same for then-Vice President Biden in 2013.

Also in attendance was Justice Elena Kagan, nominated by Obama, and all three of Trump's selections for the court: Justices Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

That presented more opportunities for awkwardness: They were seated behind Harris, who vigorously opposed all three. In particular, she conducted a heated grilling of Kavanaugh that thrilled liberals and deeply angered conservatives.

As a team, former senators Biden and Harris voted against six of the nine justices on the current court.

That might explain some of the no-shows.

Thomas, 72, and Alito, 70, are a different story.

Biden attempted to filibuster Alito's nomination and said President George W. Bush's choice was too conservative to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who at the time was the Supreme Court's pivotal justice.

Biden has even more history with Thomas, who was confirmed when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas's nomination was disrupted by allegations of sexual harassment leveled by Anita Hill, who previously had worked in government jobs with Thomas."
422	"Tiger Woods' Car Crash Cause Determined but Remains Under Wraps, Officials Seek Privacy Waiver

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has concluded its investigation into the car crash involving celebrated golfer Tiger Woods that occurred in February in California. However, the specific findings regarding the cause of the accident remain undisclosed due to privacy concerns expressed by Woods' team.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the investigation had ""determined what caused the accident,"" but they are prohibited from releasing this information publicly. This decision comes after Woods' representatives requested privacy regarding the details of the crash. ""Some privacy issues on releasing information on the investigation were asked to be kept,"" Villanueva stated, hinting at the delicacy surrounding the high-profile case.

Efforts are underway to contact Woods and his personnel about the possibility of waiving privacy to enable the release of the investigation's findings. The emphasis is on ensuring that Woods' wishes concerning his private information are respected while also balancing public interest in the incident.

On February 23, Woods was involved in a serious car accident that left his vehicle severely damaged. The crash report details that Woods' car hit a sign, tore through a tree, and ended up in the brush alongside the road with significant damages. Originally, reports surfaced noting that Woods had no recollection of driving or how the incident occurred. This was laid out in a search warrant affidavit aimed at accessing the car's black box.

According to the affidavit, though Woods was unconscious for a time following the accident, he was awake and conscious by the time deputies arrived at the scene. Deputy Johann Schloegl shared, ""We have a witness who stated Mr. Woods was unconscious after the accident."" This hints at the severity of the crash and the immediate aftermath experienced by the golf star.

Following the accident, Woods underwent emergency surgery to address major injuries sustained to his right lower leg. Mid-March saw Woods returning home to continue his recovery process. A source close to Woods tells PEOPLE, ""He's focused on his recovery and feeling grateful to be alive. Tiger appreciates all the great medical care and support he has received from friends, family, and fans.""

Woods himself has taken to social media to express his gratitude and share updates on his recovery journey. ""Happy to report that I am back home and continuing my recovery,"" Woods wrote. ""I am so grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received over the past few weeks.""

The golfing legend also shared the joy of being reunited with his children, which has undoubtedly played a significant role in his recovery. ""There is no place like home,"" he noted.

As the investigation wraps up, the public and fans of the golfer await potential future disclosures regarding the cause of the accident. Meanwhile, Woods continues to focus on his health and family, embodying resilience and determination in the face of adversity."
1783	President Donald Trump's Twitter account has been temporarily suspended for a second time after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol last week. Trump's account was suspended on January 13 for 12 hours as he was preparing to address the U.S. Congress about the violence in Washington. Twitter has taken the step again, citing 'the risk of further incitement of violence' in a statement. Trump's Twitter account was banned for 12 hours on January 13 In the statement, Twitter said the ban was a response to the 'incitement and violence that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021'.

The ban followed a U.S. Senate impeachment vote, which confirmed that Donald Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection. The ban was a result of pressure from Facebook and other social media platforms to act against President Trump, after his followers stormed the Capitol last week .

475	"Facebook shut down German research on Instagram algorithm, researchers say

Researchers at AlgorithmWatch say they were forced to abandon their research project monitoring the Instagram algorithm after legal threats from Facebook. The Berlin-based project went public with the conflict in a post published Friday morning, citing the platform's recent ban of the NYU Ad Observatory.

""There are probably more cases of bullying that we do not know about,"" the post reads. ""We hope that by coming forward, more organizations will speak up about their experiences.""

""the company cannot be trusted""

Launched in March 2020, AlgorithmWatch provided a browser plug-in that would allow users to collect data from their Instagram feeds, providing insight into how the platform prioritizes pictures and videos. The project published findings regularly, showing that the algorithm encouraged photos that showed bare skin and that photos showing faces are ranked higher than screenshots of text. Facebook disputed the methodology but did not otherwise take action against AlgorithmWatch for the first year of the project.

In May, researchers say Facebook asked to meet with the project leaders and accused them of violating the platform's terms of service. Another objection was that the project violated the GDPR, since it collected data from users who had not consented to participate.

""We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,"" the researchers say in their defense. ""In other words, users of the plug-in where only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.""

Still, the researchers ultimately chose to shut down the project, believing they would face legal action from the company if it continued.

Reached for comment, a Facebook representative confirmed the meeting, but denied threatening to sue the project, saying the company was open to find privacy-preserving ways to continue the research.

""We had concerns with their practices, which is why we contacted them multiple times so they could come into compliance with our terms and continue their research, as we routinely do with other research groups when we identify similar concerns,"" the representative said. ""We intend to keep working with independent researchers, but in ways that don't put people's data or privacy at risk.""

The social nature of the Facebook platforms makes it difficult to isolate any single user: even when a user opts in, their feed is necessarily made out of other people's content, who likely have not consented to participate in the research. Facebook has been particularly sensitive about research projects since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw academic research data ultimately used for commercial and political manipulation.

Still, the broader pattern is a troubling one. The algorithms that manage news feeds on Facebook and Instagram are immensely powerful but poorly understood, and Facebook's policies make it difficult to study them objectively. The NYU Ad Observatory, which tracked political advertising on the platform, saw its researchers banned earlier this month amid accusations of data scraping. In November, the company made similar legal threats against a browser called Friendly, which let users reorder their feeds chronologically. CrowdTangle, another popular tool for Facebook research, was acquired by the company in 2016."
1018	"House Republicans Stand Behind Cheney, Condemn Greene's Conspiracy Theories and Violent Rhetoric

In a move that highlights the internal conflicts within the Republican Party, House Republicans have decided to retain Rep. Liz Cheney as their No. 3 leader, despite her impeachment vote against former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the party has faced criticism for its handling of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has shown support for violence against Democrats and various conspiracy theories on social media.

In a 145-61 vote, House Republicans overwhelmingly supported Cheney, rejecting a hard-right conservative push to remove her for her impeachment vote against Trump. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy criticized Democrats for attempting to remove Greene from her committees, calling it a ""partisan power grab.""

""We stand united in our support for Liz Cheney as our No. 3 leader,"" McCarthy said in a statement. ""Democrats are trying to distract from their own failures by attacking one of our own. Marjorie Taylor Greene's endorsement of conspiracy theories and violent views is unacceptable, and we will not stand for it.""

Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump, stood by her decision in a closed-door session. ""I did my duty as a member of Congress and voted my conscience,"" she said. ""I will continue to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law, even if it means standing alone.""

The issue of dealing with Greene has put House Republicans under bipartisan pressure, including criticism from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""Marjorie Taylor Greene's rhetoric is unacceptable and endangers the safety of her colleagues,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""It's time for her to be held accountable.""

Chair Jim McGovern, D-Mass., also criticized Greene's endorsement of conspiracy theories and violent views. ""We cannot allow hate speech or violent rhetoric to go unchecked in our society, let alone in the halls of Congress,"" he said.

The GOP faces a pivotal moment of direction post-Trump presidency, torn between embracing Trump's divisiveness and returning to traditional conservative values. McCarthy publicly condemned Greene's endorsement of conspiracy theories and violent views after initially saying little about her.

""We must stand up for our values and reject the toxic rhetoric that threatens our democracy,"" McCarthy said. ""Marjorie Taylor Greene's actions are a stain on our party, and we must take action to address them.""

Internal GOP conflicts highlight Trump's continuing influence over the party, despite his loss in the 2020 election. Greene's endorsement of conspiracy theories and violent views has sparked a backlash within the party, with some Republicans calling for her to be removed from her committees.

""We must stand up to the toxic rhetoric that threatens our democracy,"" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said in a statement. ""Marjorie Taylor Greene's endorsement of conspiracy theories and violent views is unacceptable, and we must take action to address it.""

The issue of dealing with Greene has put House Republicans under bipartisan pressure, including criticism from McConnell. ""Marjorie Taylor Greene's rhetoric is unacceptable and endangers the safety of her colleagues,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""It's time for her to be held accountable.""

In conclusion, the decision by House Republicans to retain Cheney as their No. 3 leader and condemn Greene's conspiracy theories and violent rhetoric highlights the internal conflicts within the party. The GOP faces a pivotal moment of direction post-Trump presidency, torn between embracing Trump's divisiveness and returning to traditional conservative values. As the party navigates this complex issue, it must stand up for its values and reject the toxic rhetoric that threatens our democracy."
1685	"This Twitter exec helped decide to ban Trump. Now she must confront Twitter getting banned abroad

New York CNN Business — Two months after former US President Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, Twitter (TWTR) executive Vijaya Gadde was asked how she felt about his proposition that he might not have won the White House without the social media platform.

""To me, there's nothing better than having a political discourse in plain and open view and having access to your elected officials, and being able to hold them accountable,"" Gadde, then Twitter's general counsel, told the audience at a New York University School of Law event. ""In that sense, I think it's a great thing because this wasn't always possible before.""

""Now,"" she added, ""the consequences of that direct dialogue are unfolding in front of us and not something we could've quite predicted.""

Less than three years later, the United States faced the most troubling consequence yet: A group of rioters attacked Capitol Hill on January 6 after Trump spent weeks using social media platforms to agitate his base and spread a lie that the 2020 election had been stolen.

Gadde, who by then had become head of legal, policy and trust at Twitter, found herself at the center of deciding whether to take the unprecedented step of banning Trump from Twitter.

Two days later, Twitter permanently banned Trump, citing a ""risk of further incitement of violence."" The move was praised by civil rights advocates who called on Facebook (FB) and YouTube to follow Twitter's lead — while others said the move should have come much sooner. Facebook (FB) had blocked Trump's accounts ""indefinitely"" a day earlier, a suspension that was upheld in May by the company's court-like Oversight Board and is up for review again in November. Google-owned YouTube announced a suspension of Trump's channel a week later but has left the door open for him to return to the platform.

Twitter's decision to remove Trump didn't happen immediately. The platform initially banned Trump for 12 hours on January 6. Twitter took heat when it let him back on and he quickly tweeted again, calling his followers who stormed the Capitol ""patriots."" The Washington Post detailed a January 8 meeting in which Gadde made an ""impassioned appeal"" for staffers to have patience as her team deliberated what to do. Hours later, Twitter banned Trump permanently.

Multiple outlets reported that Gadde played a central role in the Trump ban decision. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly vacationing on a private island at the time. (Twitter has said Dorsey was closely involved in the decision.) Asked this month about her role in banning Trump, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business: ""Policy enforcement decisions are made by our Trust and Safety team, which report to Vijaya Gadde."" The spokesperson also said Twitter has ""no plans to reinstate"" Trump's account.

""Vijaya is at the crossroads of some of the most important policy decisions the company is making and how it interacts with governments around the world."" Former Twitter COO Adam Bain"
450	"Risky decision to testify pays off for Rittenhouse, law professor says

In testimony that took nearly all of Wednesday, 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse detailed step-by-step his actions on the day he killed two people and wounded a third during protests against police brutality last summer in Kenosha.

Rittenhouse got emotional as he tried to describe the first shooting and during cross-examination his attorneys filed for a mistrial during what UW-Madison School of Law professor Ion Meyn says was a confusing day for the prosecution.

Rittenhouse, who is facing charges of reckless, intentional and attempted homicide, repeatedly said he didn't do anything wrong and only shot his AR-15 rifle because he believed his life was in danger.

Late in the afternoon, lead prosecutor Thomas Binger, showing a number of videos of the night, questioned Rittenhouse about why he needed to be carrying the rifle and why he considered the men he shot a threat. Meyn says this line of questioning was one of the few times the prosecution made up some ground, but it took too long to get to those questions and by then Binger may have lost the attention of the jury.

""I didn't understand where the prosecutor was going with his cross,"" Meyn, who has worked for the Wisconsin State Public Defender and the Wisconsin Innocence Project, says. ""There should be no guessing. The general rule in cross-examination is, either you know the answer or don't care what the answer is. I felt that rule was not being followed. There was always one question too many, even if the prosecution sort of made a point, he asked that one additional question to further explain what he meant. By the time they got to what I thought was their most effective cross-examination of the day, it was the very end of the day. By that time you might have lost half the jury. To lose half the jury during a cross-examination of the defendant himself is a problem.""

Binger started his cross-examination by asking about events much earlier in the night and occasionally took tangents into topics such as Rittenhouse's video game preferences or the fact that he ignored the citywide curfew in Kenosha that night.

""If that's what you're basing your murder charge on, then you have big problems,"" Meyn said. ""I don't know what that was supposed to accomplish except sympathy for the defendant. The optics for the prosecution would be terrible, the last thing they want to emphasize is that it's a kid.""

""They started with the curfew, oh my gosh,"" he adds. ""You have a murder case and you're talking about a curfew violation first? Who cares if someone's not supposed to be there, what does it have to do with intentional homicide?""

Instead of focusing on video games or curfew violations, Meyn says he would have focused more on why Rittenhouse thought his life was threatened and how he could claim that he himself wasn't a threat to Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz, his victims.

""I would have gone through each of these things, these people aren't related, aren't together, aren't in a gang, none of them know each other,"" Meyn says, ""That should be the emphasis of the cross. You shot three people in three minutes. You describe a mob, no one here knew each other. These incidents had space between them. And then the first two didn't have a weapon.""

""How strong does that get after he shoots someone, after he's running down the street with an AR-15?"" he continues. ""That is a threat. I would've focused on Grosskreutz, when you saw him with a gun he became a threat, yes? So it's OK that you — it's reasonable when you see someone with a gun [to view them as a threat] but not when he sees someone with a gun?""

The decision over whether or not a defendant should testify is always a risky one for the defense, but according to Meyn it mostly paid off for Rittenhouse.

""Rittenhouse as a witness did phenomenal,"" he says. ""[He] maintained control of his narrative during the entirety of cross. Never waivered, regardless how many times he was asked to admit x, y or z. That's extraordinary."""
1481	"With journeymen receivers or stars, Tom Brady just wins

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tom Brady won his first Super Bowl throwing to Troy Brown, Jermaine Wiggins and David Patten and earned his seventh ring firing passes to Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Antonio Brown and Rob Gronkowski.

There's a significant talent gap between his first crew of journeymen in New England and the all-star cast he has in Tampa Bay, but the common theme is No. 12.

Brady won with Deion Branch, David Givens, Brandon LaFell, Malcolm Mitchell, Chris Hogan and Danny Amendola, and he helped Julian Edelman and Wes Welker become stars.

He's relied on throwing to his running backs from J.R. Redmond and Kevin Faulk to Shane Vereen and James White. His tight ends have always been favorite targets from Wiggins, Daniel Graham and Benjamin Watson to Aaron Hernandez, Martellus Bennett and Gronkowski.

Brady's best receiver along the way was Hall of Famer Randy Moss. They broke records together and went 16-0 in 2007 but didn't win it all.

The 44-year-old, five-time Super Bowl MVP faces the Patriots on Sunday night for the first time since leaving New England after 20 years. He'll see plenty of familiar faces on the opposite sideline, including his leading receiver from their first Super Bowl victory two decades ago.

Troy Brown caught six of Brady's passes for 89 yards when the Patriots stunned the ""Greatest Show on Turf"" Rams in Super Bowl 36. Brown now coaches New England's wide receivers and kick returners.

""I played with the guy for a long time and coached with him for a couple of years while he was here,"" Brown said. ""It's a little bit awkward, but at the end of the day, it's still about competing and going against each other. That's what it comes down to. I mean, I know I'm not playing, but still, you're approaching the game as we do every other team around the league, is that we do everything we can to prepare for what they have. We'll approach this game the same way, not because Tom Brady is Tom Brady or whatever it is, because it's the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. We have a really good football team all around.""

Brown isn't surprised Brady is still playing at an elite level all these years later. The GOAT already has 10 touchdown passes in three games, putting him on pace to set a new career high. He threw 50 TD passes, including 23 to Moss, in '07.

""Well, I think if anybody can pull it off, it would be Tom Brady,"" Brown said. ""He's been that type of guy his entire career. No reason to think that he wouldn't still be playing. He said when he came into the league that he would play forever. And so, he's trying to make that come true, I guess.""

Wiggins had two catches for 14 yards in New England's first Super Bowl win. The Boston native can't believe Brady switched teams.

""I still haven't been able to get over it since he left here. I never thought I'd see it coming where he'd be wearing another uniform,"" Wiggins said. ""Brady I thought would be that guy that I thought the only uniform he would wear would be the New England Patriots one. Then when he left, it was weird to see him in that Tampa Bay uniform. To this day I can't get used to it because that championship he won down there I feel like could have been another one he won in New England.""

Patriots coach Bill Belichick said earlier this week he didn't want Brady to leave.

""He looked at his options and made his decision. We weren't as good of an option as Tampa,"" Belichick said on his weekly radio appearance on WEEI. ""You'd have to ask him about all that, but it wasn't a question of not wanting him, that's for sure.""

Brady wouldn't elaborate on a report that Belichick spoke to him on the phone instead of meeting with him in person when he was a free agent last year."
31	"Microsoft says group behind SolarWinds hack now targeting government agencies, NGOs

Nobelium, originating from Russia, is the same actor behind the attacks on SolarWinds customers in 2020, according to Microsoft.

The comments come weeks after a May 7 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline shut the United States' largest fuel pipeline network for several days, disrupting the country's supply.

""This wave of attacks targeted approximately 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organizations"", Microsoft said on Thursday.

While organisations in the United States received the largest share of attacks, targeted victims came from at least 24 countries, Microsoft said.

At least a quarter of the targeted organisations were involved in international development, humanitarian issues and human rights work, Microsoft said in the blog.

Nobelium launched this week's attacks by breaking into an email marketing account used by the United States Agency For International Development (USAID) and from there launching phishing attacks on many other organisations, Microsoft said.

In statements issued Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and USAID both said they were aware of the hacking and were investigating.

The hack of information technology company SolarWinds, which was identified in December, gave access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products. Microsoft President Brad Smith described the attack as ""the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen"". read more

This month, Russia's spy chief denied responsibility for the SolarWinds cyber attack but said he was ""flattered"" by the accusations from the United States and Britain that Russian foreign intelligence was behind such a sophisticated hack.

The United States and Britain have blamed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), successor to the foreign spying operations of the KGB, for the hack which compromised nine U.S. federal agencies and hundreds of private sector companies.

The attacks disclosed by Microsoft on Thursday appeared to be a continuation of multiple efforts to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts, Microsoft said."

Then, provide a brief summary of the incident before delving into the key points.

The Ever Given, a 200,000 ton mega-container carrier, became stuck in the Suez Canal six days ago, causing a major disruption in international shipping. After being refloated, Egyptian authorities are now seeking over $1 billion in compensation for the incident, which held up $9 billion in global trade per day and left 422 vessels waiting to pass through the Suez Canal. Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, cited losses in canal revenue, equipment costs, and manpower as reasons for the high compensation figure, and hopes for a compensation agreement soon but did not specify who might be liable to pay."
518	"New Orleans garbage hasn't been collected for weeks. So, the residents threw a Trash Parade.

Louisiana residents recovering from the aftermath of Hurricane Ida are dealing with another problem, and it stinks - New Orleans garbage hasn't been collected for weeks.

Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven't had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit on Aug. 29.

The stench – which has drawn countless bugs and rats – got so bad in parts of the city last week that lifelong New Orleans resident, Aaron ""Louisiana"" Grant, joked on Facebook that he and others should stage a garbage parade and dress in trash-themed costumes while depositing their debris at the doors of City Hall.

On Wednesday, he created a New Orleans Trash Parade group on Facebook. By Friday night, more than 1,900 people had expressed interest in joining.

Grant, 41, estimates the number of protesters Saturday afternoon was closer to 150, which dwindled to 100 as inclement weather dampened enthusiasm. Those who showed up did so in all sorts of creative costumes, including a fly, Oscar the Grouch (trash can included) and Grant's favorite, Marie Antoinette, who held a sign that said: ""Let them eat trash.""

Being witty and satirical in the aftermath of a disaster, said Grant, is ""a coping mechanism.""

""When I called City Hall to apply for a permit, I was asked, 'Is it a protest or a parade? Those are two different categories,'"" Grant recalled. ""I think it's both. Everyone there was upset to a certain degree, and we're using the opportunity to both vent and make a point.""

Only two bags of trash were placed in front of City Hall's doors Saturday. But as Grant sat on his stoop Monday afternoon, garbage still hadn't been hauled away.

""When I turn and look 360 degrees, all I see is trash everywhere,"" he said. ""It's absolutely revolting. The temperatures have been in the high 80s and low 90s, so you can imagine how bad it smells.""

Last week, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell acknowledged as much, saying on Twitter: ""No getting around it. The situation stinks.""

Cantrell said it's a workforce problem: Before Ida hit, the sanitation department was already strapped for employees due to a nationwide shortage. Ida made conditions considerably worse. According to other media outlets and an announcement from Cantrell, the city is now looking for help from outside contractors.

Grant, who manages a live music venue in the French Quarter, isn't impressed. He said the garbage situation is ""the most visible example of the failures of local government."" Elected officials should have planned for this, he said, and had contracts already signed."
1414	"Prince Harry, Meghan and the Bidens to appear at vaccine benefit concert

The Royals Report: Prince Harry and Meghan's first Netflix series to focus on Invictus Games

Prince Harry and Meghan will serve as the campaign chairs of Global Citizen's effort to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to medical workers in the world's poorest countries.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will appear at ""Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World,"" to be taped Sunday at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and air on ABC, CBS, FOX, YouTube and iHeartMedia broadcast radio stations on May 8, Global Citizen, the anti-poverty nonprofit, announced Tuesday.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will also appear during the broadcast as part of the ""We Can Do This"" initiative to increase confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Croatian Prime Andrej Minister Plenković will also appear at the concert, which will be hosted by Selena Gomez and headlined by Jennifer Lopez.

Harry and Meghan are also leading an effort to raise money for the vaccine-sharing program COVAX, which hopes to produce $19 billion to pay for the vaccines for medical workers.

Global Citizen said the idea is to push businesses to ""donate dollars for doses,"" and the world's seven biggest economies to share excess vaccine supplies with countries in need.

As of April, 60 nations had still not yet received any COVID-19 vaccines, Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans told the Associated Press.

The celebrities will also urge pharmaceutical companies ""including Moderna to make vaccines available at not-for-profit prices.""

Foo Fighters, Eddie Vedder, J Balvin and H.E.R. are also set to perform at the concert, with hosts Chrissy Teigen, David Letterman, Gayle King and Jimmy Kimmel and actors Ben Affleck, Nomzamo Mbatha, Olivia Munn and Sean Penn now also set to appear. The event is part of a growing chorus seeking wider, more equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

""Last autumn, I called for the sharing of the doses ordered by our countries, to ensure both solidarity and health security,"" Macron said in a statement. ""With the European vaccine sharing mechanism via the COVAX initiative that France is inaugurating, we are in concrete solidarity in the fight against the virus, which does not care about borders. Today I call on all my colleagues to join this momentum and make a commitment at Vax Live."""
1948	"Tiger Woods: Golfer 'fortunate' to survive after Genesis SUV crash, police say

""It's very fortunate for Mr Woods to come out of this alive.""

That's the latest from Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputy Carlos Gonzalez, one of the first officers to arrive on the scene after golfer Tiger Woods wrecked his SUV outside of Los Angeles on Tuesday. He said the golfer was wearing his seatbelt, which might have saved his life, and appeared ""calm and lucid.""

The PGA legend, who sustained ""serious injuries to both legs"" according to officials, was rushed to surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center after his car hit a median and rolled end-over-end for about 100 feet until settling off the side of the road.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said during a press conference on Tuesday that there was ""no evidence of impairment"" at the scene of the incident.

""There was no evidence of impairment,"" Mr Villanueva said during his remarks. ""There was no effort to draw blood, for example, at the hospital.""

Sheriffs will investigate the incident for a variety of different causes and release their findings in a matter of days or weeks.

A second crash occurred after another driver had stopped to help Mr Woods, according to local officials. The wreck was minor and no one was hurt.

A slew of sporting figures, as well as former president Donald Trump, have become the first to publicly send their ""prayers"" and ""thoughts"" to Mr Woods, via social media, as he is treated in hospital."
1943	"Facebook Whistleblower Exposes Company's Mispriorities and Misdeeds

Oct 3 (Reuters) – In a bombshell revelation, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen accused the social media giant of prioritizing profit over combating hate speech and misinformation, leading to a series of complaints filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Haugen, a former product manager for Facebook's Civic Misinformation Team, unveiled her identity on the CBS program ""60 Minutes"" after a series of Wall Street Journal articles scrutinized the company's practices.

Haugen's decision to go public comes ahead of her scheduled testimony at a Senate subcommittee hearing titled ""Protecting Kids Online,"" where she will address the impact of Instagram, owned by Facebook, on teenagers. Her allegations paint a damning picture of Facebook's internal operations, claiming that the company was fully aware of its platforms fostering discord and causing harm to teens, yet chose to prioritize its financial interests over the well-being of its users.

""Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about what its own research reveals about the safety of children, the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems, and its role in spreading misinformation and political polarization,"" Haugen asserted.

Haugen's revelations implicate Facebook in the organization of the Capitol riot on January 6, alleging that the company deactivated safety systems post-election, contributing to the spread of misinformation and the subsequent violence.

Facebook, however, contested Haugen's accusations, with spokesperson Lena Pietsch asserting that the company has been continuously improving its efforts to curb harmful content. ""We have invested heavily in people and technology to keep our platform safe, and we will continue to make improvements,"" Pietsch stated.

Facebook's Vice President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, vehemently dismissed the notion that social media caused the January 6 Capitol riot, calling it ""ludicrous.""

Despite Facebook's defense, Haugen's attorney confirmed that internal documents have been shared with several state attorneys general, indicating potential legal consequences for the company. Additionally, discussions are underway regarding regulatory actions on an international scale.

Haugen's decision to come forward has garnered support from Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit organization that provides legal and financial assistance to whistleblowers. The organization has launched a GoFundMe campaign to support Haugen's legal expenses, which have already exceeded $100,000.

""Frances Haugen has shown immense courage in coming forward to expose the truth about Facebook's practices,"" said John Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid. ""We are proud to support her in her fight for accountability and transparency.""

Haugen's revelations have sparked a renewed debate about the role of social media companies in society and the need for stricter regulations to protect users from harm. As the Senate subcommittee hearing approaches, Haugen's testimony is expected to shed further light on Facebook's internal practices and the potential consequences of prioritizing profit over the well-being of its users."
2042	"Man spotted with AR-15 outside Kyle Rittenhouse trial confirms he is a fired Ferguson police officer

KENOSHA — A man who screamed obscenities about Black Lives Matter and carried an AR-15 rifle outside the Kenosha County Courthouse while the Kyle Rittenhouse jury deliberated is a former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer, he confirmed Thursday.

Records show the man — who initially identified himself as ""Maserati Mike"" — is Jesse Kline, who had been a member of the Ferguson Police Department for three years. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kline was fired from the Ferguson Police Department in 2018 after being charged with stalking a woman and threatening her male companion by poking his chest with a handgun.

The criminal charges were later dropped because the couple refused to testify, the newspaper reported.

Kline confirmed he used to be with the Police Department.

""Jesse Kline. Prior Ferguson police Officer Jesse Kline,"" he shouted at the crowd.

Kline joined the Ferguson Police Department in 2015, following the shooting of Michael Brown, a Black man, by a white police officer. Brown's death, which did not result in criminal charges, sparked protests and acts of vandalism in the St. Louis suburb.

Kline has protested outside the Kenosha County Courthouse for the past three days, bringing a gun to the demonstration Wednesday for a brief time. Wearing a tactical vest, button-down shirt, bow tie, slacks and dress shoes, Kline spent part of the morning yelling ""Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organization"" and screaming ""(expletive) BLM!"" through a megaphone as he stood in the public way across the street from the courthouse.

Kenosha County sheriff's deputies told Kline, who drove to the courthouse in a Maserati with Illinois plates, that he could not have the rifle there because he was within 1,000 feet of a school if he did not have a permit.

""If you want to be here, you're going to have to put the rifle away,"" a deputy said.

Under Wisconsin law, any individual who knowingly possesses a firearm at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a school is subject to a fine up to $1,000. A sheriff's spokesman said the incident was resolved without action when he voluntarily put away his rifle.

Kline, who had attended the protests a day earlier with a dog, returned to the courthouse without a rifle, though he kept a sound system that blasted ""Build a B----"" by Bella Poarch and ""Ride It"" by DJ Regard, among other TikTok hits.

He returned to the courthouse Thursday with his dog, carrying a bullhorn and a long, narrow tote bag that was similar in appearance to a rifle case.

""I don't talk to the media,"" he shouted, pacing back and forth with the animal while playing rap music."
488	"Tom Brady Admits Throwing the Lombardi Trophy During Super Bowl Boat Parade 'Was Not Smart'

Tom Brady is speaking candidly about his antics while celebrating his seventh Super Bowl win back in February.

While appearing on Good Morning America Wednesday, the 43-year-old Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback opened up about tossing the coveted Lombardi Trophy from one boat to another during a waterway victory parade that took place on the Hillsborough River in downtown Tampa, Florida, following the 2021 Super Bowl.

When asked by GMA co-host Michael Strahan about his thought process before the throw, Brady said, ""There was not a lot going through my mind at that point.""

""That was not smart for a couple of reasons,"" he continued. ""One is if we drop it, that's a little bit of a problem.""

""But the worst thing that could happen is the edges on that trophy are so sharp and had those things clipped one of my boys on the other boat, it would have been an ugly, ugly parade,"" he added.

After the Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs at Raymond James Stadium to win Super Bowl LV, the Florida team celebrated on boats in a waterway parade instead of the traditional winners' parade due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Players including Brady — who was joined by his kids — and Rob Gronkowski rode on various watercraft around the harbor area, clad in the team's signature bright red and white.

During his time with GMA, Brady admitted to Strahan, 49, of the celebrations, ""I had a lot of fun and I don't get to do that.""

""It's hard to relax and when you're out in public, and there's phones — not that I would do anything — but it still doesn't feel like comfortable for me, my personality, to have people filming,"" he said. ""So I tend to just stay at home more and I don't go out a lot.""

In his GMA sit-down, Brady also spoke about his wife, Gisele Bündchen, and credited the supermodel with keeping their marriage strong.

""I give her a lot of credit for that,"" said Brady, who shares two kids with Bündchen, 40 — son Benjamin Rein, 11, and daughter Vivian Lake, 8. (He is also dad to 13-year-old son John ""Jack"" Edward with ex Bridget Moynahan.)

""She's the one that, you know, supports the family and, at the end of the day, makes a lot of sacrifices,"" he added. ""She brings out the best version of me.""

Brady also spoke about keeping his children ""grounded"" as they grow up, making sure that they know they'll have to ""work hard"" in life.

He explained, ""Mom and Dad's life is very unique in this world. I don't want them to take those things for granted. I want them to make the impact in the world that they're gonna make. But they're gonna make it in their way, too."""
813	"Brandon Lee's Sister Shannon Calls for 'Mandatory Gun Safety Training' on Film Sets After 'Rust' Death

Shannon Lee wants mandatory gun safety training on any film set that handles firearms.

After the Rust on-set tragedy in which cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed when actor Alec Baldwin fired a real lead bullet from a prop gun, the sister of late actor Brandon Lee is sharing her point of view. Brandon died at age 28 in a similar accident in March 1993 on the set of his film The Crow.

""I think that mandatory gun safety training [should be required] for the actor so that they can check the guns themselves and know how to use them appropriately, and so that they can keep others safe,"" Shannon, 52, told AFP, calling gun safety measures that are in place right now ""frustrating.""

Shannon said she never spoke to the man who fired the fatal shot in her brother's case, Michael Massee, before he died in 2016, adding that she hopes Baldwin, 66, takes care of himself in the difficult aftermath.

""I felt really sorry because it is a horrible thing to cause someone else to die. And I also feel sorry for Alec Baldwin,"" she said. ""It's really tough what he's going through. He has to take care of himself.""

When news of the Rust incident broke, Shannon, the daughter of Bruce Lee, wrote on Twitter, ""Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on Rust. No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period.""

Last month, Brandon's fiancée Eliza Hutton came forward for the first time since he died, telling PEOPLE that the recent accident on the New Mexico set of Rust is yet another ""avoidable tragedy.""

""Twenty-eight years ago, I was shattered by the shock and grief of losing the love of my life, Brandon Lee, so senselessly. My heart aches again now for Halyna Hutchins' husband and son, and for all those left in the wake of this avoidable tragedy,"" Hutton, 57, said.

""I urge those in positions to make change to consider alternatives to real guns on sets,"" she added.

Baldwin has been in contact with Hutchins' husband, Matthew Hutchins, and 9-year-old son Andros since the tragedy, and had breakfast with them two days after the shooting. The former 30 Rock star told paparazzi last week that Hutchins was his ""friend,"" adding that he and wife Hilaria Baldwin have been ""very worried"" about Matthew and Andros.

The shooting happened on Oct. 21. During a rehearsal, assistant director David Halls unknowingly handed Alec a gun that had been loaded with real bullets. Thinking it was only loaded with blanks, Halls shouted ""cold gun"" to indicate it was safe to use, according to a Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office search warrant affidavit.

Neither Halls nor Baldwin knew that the gun had live ammunition in it, according to the affidavit.

The investigation remains ongoing, with production on the film halted. No charges have been filed, though authorities have said that ""all options are on the table at this point"" and ""no one has been ruled out"" as they search for answers as to what led to the fatal shooting."
381	"Life's a Bitche: Facebook says sorry for shutting down town's page

Life's a Bitche for one historic town in north-east France that has received an apology from Facebook after its page was shut down for apparently using offensive language.

Bitche in the Moselle, population 5,000 and home to the Bitchois, fell foul of the social network's algorithm, which deemed it insulting and removed it without explanation last month.

On Tuesday, after reports of the Facebook suspension spread, the social network restored the Ville de Bitche page.

The mayor, Benoît Kieffer, said in a post: ""The name of our town seems to suffer from a bad interpretation ... the most astonishing thing is that Facebook took so long to correct this. The president/director general of Facebook France has just contacted me personally to tell me the Ville de Bitche page is published again and to apologise for the inconvenience caused.""

Facebook told the Guardian the page was unpublished because of an incorrect analysis by its systems and has now been restored.

The town's page disappeared from Facebook on 19 March without any warning or apparent reason. In the interim, town hall staff created a new page, Mairie 57230, the town's postcode, to keep its residents up to date with local news and information.

Before the page was reinstated, Valérie Degouy, a spokesperson for Bitche, toldthe local radio station Radio Melodie: ""I appealed on 19 March but [the page] hasn't reappeared again. I have tried every way to contact Facebook, through the different forms, but there is nothing more to do. I tried to send a private message on the Facebook France page, I left about 10 messages every day. I was finally contacted and told that they were not in charge, that if I appealed, I would have to wait for a response from Facebook.

""I already had problems when I created the town's Facebook page. I could not enter the word Bitche, it was impossible. I had to create a page that I had called Ville fortifiée, and change it afterwards, in the description, to say that it was the official page of the town of Bitche and point out at the same time, the username was Ville de Bitche. At that time in 2016, it was allowed.""

She added: ""I created a new page and called it Mairie 57230. I would have liked to call it Mairie de Bitche but the word doesn't work. There is a logo of the city of Bitche which clearly shows that it is Bitche. The cover photo is the town hall.""

After Facebook restored the town's page, Kieffer said: ""I and my fellow citizens would like to humbly invite Monsieur Mark Zuckerberg and Monsieur the president general of Facebook France to our lovely fortified town, which has distinguished itself in history several times.

""Together, we can honour together the memory of compatriots and our American friends who under the flag of the 100 Infantry Division came from South Carolina to liberate our town: liberators who called themselves, with pride, the 'sons of Bitche'."""
80	"Kyle Rittenhouse, Acquitted in Kenosha Shootings, Says He's Not Racist, Supports BLM

New York – Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who was acquitted of all charges related to the shootings during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has spoken out about his case, insisting he's not a racist and supports the Black Lives Matter movement.

In an interview with Tucker Carlson set to air on Fox News, Rittenhouse said the case was about the right to self-defense, not race. ""I'm not a racist, I support peaceful demonstrations,"" Rittenhouse said, according to a preview of the interview released by Fox News.

Rittenhouse, who is white, as were the men he shot, emphasized that his actions were not motivated by racial hatred. ""I don't care about race, I care about people,"" he said. ""I believe in the Black Lives Matter movement, I believe in peaceful protests.""

A spokesman for the Rittenhouse family, David Hancock, described Kyle as caring, empathetic, and civic-minded. ""Kyle is a young man who cares deeply about his community and the people in it,"" Hancock said. ""He's always been passionate about social justice and supports the Black Lives Matter movement.""

Rittenhouse was 17 when he traveled to Kenosha, which had been rocked by protests following the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer. During his trial, Rittenhouse argued he fired in self-defense after being attacked.

Despite being photographed with members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for its anti-progressive views, Rittenhouse's attorneys deny he is a white supremacist. ""Kyle is not a member of any hate group, and he rejects any ideology that promotes hatred or violence,"" Hancock said.

Rittenhouse's acquittal has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a warning sign for Black communities about ""vigilante justice."" NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson views the trial result as a ""warning shot"" for Black communities. ""The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse is a clear example of the double standard of justice in America,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""It's a warning shot to Black communities that vigilante justice is alive and well.""

Rittenhouse's case has been a focal point for debates on Second Amendment rights and protests against police brutality. His acquittal has sparked protests and calls for justice, with many arguing that Rittenhouse's actions were motivated by racial hatred.

However, Rittenhouse maintains that his actions were not racially motivated. ""I don't see race, I see people,"" he said in the interview with Tucker Carlson. ""I believe in the Black Lives Matter movement, I believe in peaceful protests. I'm not a racist, I'm a human being.""

Rittenhouse's attorneys have also emphasized that their client's actions were not motivated by racial hatred. ""Kyle Rittenhouse is not a racist, and his actions were not motivated by racial animus,"" attorney John Pierce said in a statement. ""He is a young man who cares deeply about his community and the people in it.""

The Rittenhouse family has also released a statement, expressing their gratitude for the acquittal and emphasizing their son's commitment to social justice. ""We are grateful for the jury's decision, and we believe that justice has been served,"" the statement read. ""Kyle is a caring and empathetic young man who supports peaceful protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.""

The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse has sparked a national conversation about race, justice, and the role of vigilante justice in American society. While Rittenhouse maintains that his actions were not racially motivated, many critics argue that his actions were a manifestation of systemic racism and a symptom of a broader problem in American society.

Regardless of one's opinion on Rittenhouse's actions, it is clear that the case has highlighted the deep divisions and tensions that exist in American society. As the nation continues to grapple with issues of race, justice, and inequality, the Rittenhouse case serves as a powerful reminder of the need for constructive dialogue and meaningful change."
1182	"The Bright Future of ""Kryin'"" Kyle Rittenhouse

I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving. This year marks the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving with the indigenous population. (It's likely, however, if the Indians had known where this was going they might have suggested the Pilgrims order out.)

A little more than a week ago, on November 19th, 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty by a jury of eleven white people and one person of color, of all five charges including murder, stemming from a deadly street protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2020. The day before Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot four times in the back and three times on the side as he opened the driver's door to his girlfriend's SUV.

Amazingly, Blake survived though he required numerous surgeries. But the white cop who fired the shots faced no charges. This led to angry protests in the streets that included considerable looting. TV coverage and social media apparently inspired Rittenhouse, then 17, to drive from Antioch, Illinois to Kenosha. Unfortunately, he was carrying his trusty assault rifle. (Despite being under age to have any gun, much less such the deadly the AR-15.)

So it was Rittenhouse killed two men and permanently paralyzed a third but claimed self defense. In what some labeled an Oscar worthy performance, in his trial testimony Rittenhouse broke down crying. It was rather odd, however, because there were no tears. (To be fair, he didn't have the benefit of tear-inducing glycerin that actors and actresses use.)

Kyle got an ""A"" for effort as he squeezed his face and squinted his eyes over and over hoping to open the flood gates but it only released a tiny drop. At one point he sneaked a peek at the jury to see if they were buying it.

(Spoiler alert: They were!)

Yes, ""Kryin' Kyle"" got off scot free and is the darling of the right wing gun rights activists. Ted Nugent, the over the hill rocker, reportedly has offered to provide Rittenhouse a lifetime's worth of ammunition. (What could go wrong there?)

The history of unarmed black men being killed by white men goes back to slavery that began in this country in 1619 when 20 enslaved Africans arrived in Jamestown. But in the public eye where an unarmed black man is killed by someone who claims self defense, that may have started with George Zimmerman.

On February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida, George Zimmerman fatally shot Travon Martin and was also found not guilty. I could list dozens, maybe hundreds of similar cases but I'm only allowed 800 words.

Such is the current case in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year old black man who went jogging and tragically he wound up dead. The three white men who were charged with his murder claimed self defense. Thankfully, they were all found guilty."

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, have once again demonstrated their commitment to social causes with a substantial donation to Harvest Home, a Los Angeles-based charity that supports homeless pregnant women. In collaboration with their charitable foundation, Archewell, as well as Procter & Gamble and Pampers, the couple donated a significant quantity of diapers to the organization.

Harvest Home took to their Instagram account to express heartfelt gratitude for the donation, specifically mentioning its contribution to their newly established Pico-Robertson Home. This act of kindness aligns with the 'Million Acts of Love Campaign,' an initiative aimed at spreading compassion and support within communities.

Since relocating to California, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have forged a connection with Harvest Home. On Mother's Day, they made an earlier donation to the charity through their Archewell Foundation, showcasing their dedication to the cause. The Duchess of Sussex recently released a statement addressing the significance of community support and access to essential pregnancy resources.

In her statement, Meghan emphasized the importance of mental well-being during pregnancy, particularly for women of color and those from under-resourced communities who often face additional challenges. She expressed her belief in the power of community in providing a safety net for vulnerable mothers, aligning with Harvest Home's mission to empower and support these women.

Meghan's words reflect her ongoing advocacy for marginalized communities and her commitment to using her platform to raise awareness about social issues. By partnering with Harvest Home and other organizations, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex continue to make a tangible difference in the lives of those they seek to help.

Through their Archewell Foundation, Harry and Meghan have embarked on a journey of impactful philanthropy, focusing on issues close to their hearts. This latest donation serves as a reminder of the couple's dedication to creating positive change, one compassionate act at a time. As they continue to support organizations like Harvest Home, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex inspire others to join them in their mission to make a lasting difference in the world."

Hurricane Ida left an extensive trail of damaged homes, infrastructure, and lives from Louisiana to New England. It also has left a stain on the sea. Two weeks after the storm, several federal and state agencies and some private companies are working to find and contain oil leaks in the Gulf of Mexico.

The U.S. Coast Guard has assessed more than 1,500 reports of pollution in the Gulf and in Louisiana, and it ""is prioritizing nearly 350 reported incidents for further investigation by state, local, and federal authorities in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida."" The Coast Guard is working with the Environmental Protection Agency, the state of Louisiana, the National Ocean Service, and other agencies to chronicle and monitor the state of coastal waters and infrastructure.

On September 3, 2021, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 acquired this natural-color image of apparent oil slicks off the southeastern Louisiana coast near Port Fourchon, a major hub of the oil and gas industry.

Hurricane Ida caused the disruption of 90 to 95 percent of the region's crude oil and gas production, while also damaging current and abandoned pipelines and structures. According to many news reports, the surface oil slicks near Port Fourchon (shown above) are likely related to as many as three damaged or ruptured submarine pipelines. It is unclear how much oil has spilled into the Gulf of Mexico.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has conducted aerial surveys of some offshore waters and has released the photos online. The NASA-sponsored Delta-X research team has also been working in the area and was called upon to make some observations of the slicks and other coastal changes with synthetic aperture radar.

Beyond active oil and gas extraction platforms, the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico is covered in a maze of pipelines, capped wellheads, and other infrastructure that can be vulnerable to storm events. In a report issued earlier this year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office stated: ""Since the 1960s, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has allowed the offshore oil and gas industry to leave 97 percent of pipelines (18,000 miles) on the seafloor when no longer in use. Pipelines can contain oil or gas if not properly cleaned in decommissioning.""

1930	"Russian Cyber Attack Suspects: The 2020 SolarWinds Attacks Russian State Diversifies Threats Washington Post Monday, December 11, 2023

In a worrying development, the US Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that a Russian criminal group is responsible for a cyber attack that left at least three US citizens dead on Monday, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The attack took place at the same company responsible for stealing critical software, the sources said, adding that it is unclear if the company has taken any steps to prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future.

""This is worrying, as we know how vulnerable our systems are, particularly when there are people working outside of the United States,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We are taking additional steps to ensure that our systems are up to date and up-to-date to prevent further incidents.""

The US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Crimes Unit confirmed that Russian authorities are responsible for the cyber attacks, and they are conducting background checks on the attackers and verifying their identity before undertaking any further investigations.

The Russian authorities have said they are working to contain the attack and are urging the public to remain vigilant.

On Monday, December 11, 2023, the US Department of Homeland Security announced that its Cyber Crimes Section was investigating the cyber attacks, but it did not specify how many of the affected individuals had been affected. The attacks occurred on January 3rd, 2023, when the Russian government launched a cyber attack against a US healthcare system, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The attacks were the latest in a series of attacks targeting healthcare systems in Russia.

In a statement, the White House said that the US government had been working closely with Russia to identify and stop this attack, but it also emphasized that the cybersecurity of the US system was still in its infancy and that the US government would continue to support those affected.

The White House also urged the world to take proactive measures against the spread of cyber-attacks, such as implementing enhanced encryption measures and implementing measures to prevent the spread of malicious actors.

In addition, the US Embassy in Moscow issued a statement saying, ""We are committed to protecting the sensitive security of our systems and to taking swift steps to address any threats and threats to our systems.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of the threat posed by the hacktivist group known as ""Petya"" and said that he is willing to work with the United States to contain its own cyber threats.

Monday, December 11, 2023, President Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Russia will cooperate with the US government in investigating the hacks of US healthcare systems."
1950	"Islamic State uses Taliban's own tactics to attack Afghanistan's new rulers

Sept 23 (Reuters) - A little more than a month after toppling the Western-backed government in Kabul, Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers are facing internal enemies who have adopted many of the tactics of urban warfare that marked their own successful guerrilla campaign.

A deadly attack on Kabul airport last month and a series of bomb blasts in the eastern city of Jalalabad, all claimed by the local affiliate of Islamic State, have underlined the threat to stability from violent militant groups who remain unreconciled to the Taliban.

While the movement's spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has downplayed the threat, saying this week that Islamic State had no effective presence in Afghanistan, commanders on the ground do not dismiss the threat so lightly.

Two members of the movement's intelligence services who investigated some of the recent attacks in Jalalabad said the tactics showed the group remained a danger, even if it did not have enough fighters and resources to seize territory.

Using sticky bombs - magnetic bombs usually stuck to the underside of cars - the attacks targeted Taliban members in exactly the same way the Taliban itself used to hit officials and civil society figures to destabilize the former government.

""We are worried about these sticky bombs that once we used to apply to target our enemies in Kabul. We are concerned about our leadership as they could target them if not controlled them successfully,"" said one of the Taliban intelligence officials.

Islamic State in Khorasan, the name taken from the ancient name for the region that includes modern Afghanistan, first emerged in late 2014 but has declined from its peak around 2018 following a series of heavy losses inflicted by both the Taliban and U.S. forces.

Taliban security forces in Nangarhar said they had killed three members of the movement on Wednesday night and the intelligence officials said the movement still retains the ability to cause trouble through small-scale attacks.

""Their main structure is broken and they are now divided in small groups to carry out attacks,"" one of them said.

FUNDING DRIED UP

The Taliban have said repeatedly that they will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries. But some Western analysts believe the return of the Islamist group to power has invigorated groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda, which had made Afghanistan their base when the Taliban last ruled the country.

""In Afghanistan, the return of Taliban is a huge victory for the Islamists,"" said Rohan Gunaratna, professor of security studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. ""They have celebrated the return of the Taliban, so I think that Afghanistan is the new theatre.""

ISIS-K is believed to draw many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or the Pakistani version of the Taliban, known as the TTP, but much of the way it operates remains little understood.

It has fought the Taliban over smuggling routes and other economic interests but it also supports a global Caliphate under Islamic law, in contrast with the Taliban which insists it has no interest in anywhere outside Afghanistan.

Most analysts, as well as the United Nations peg ISIS-K's strength at under 2,000 fighters, compared to as many as 100,000 at the Taliban's disposal. The ranks of ISIS-K were swollen with prisoners released when Afghanistan's jails were opened by the Taliban as they swept through the country.

According to a June report by the UN security council, ISIS-K's financial and logistic ties to its parent organisation in Syria have weakened, though it does retain some channels of communication.

""Funding support to the Khorasan branch from the core is believed to have effectively dried up,"" the report said."
929	"Meghan and Harry weren't legally married before public wedding, archbishop says

CNN — The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not legally married prior to their televised wedding, clarifying comments made by the duchess in the couple's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.

The interview contained plenty of revelations, including the news that Meghan and Harry had exchanged vows in private a few days before the ceremony.

""You know, three days before our wedding, we got married,"" said Meghan. ""No one knows that. The vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury.""

The duchess didn't elaborate on the private service, but many people deduced that it wasn't legally binding because of the absence of witnesses.

Welby, who led the couple in their public vows on May 19, 2018, has now shed more light on events.

""The legal wedding was on the Saturday. I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offense if I had signed it knowing it was false,"" Welby said, in comments first reported by Italian newspaper La Repubblica and confirmed to CNN by Lambeth Palace.

""So, you can make what you like of that. But the legal wedding was on the Saturday, but I won't say what happened at any earlier meetings,"" the archbishop added.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

However, in January last year, the pair announced they would step back from the royal family.

Earlier this month, they used a heavily publicized interview with Oprah to discuss their experiences, including allegations of racism within the family itself and Meghan's admission that she felt suicidal during her pregnancy.

The two-hour TV special was highly anticipated because Harry and Meghan are now allowed to speak more freely about the royal family after their effective split from the palace.

In one of the interview's most startling revelations, Meghan said an unnamed member of the family raised the issue of how dark their unborn baby Archie's skin would be while she was pregnant."

124	"President Biden Surveys Hurricane Ida's Devastation in New Jersey and New York, Urges Climate Action

President Joe Biden toured flood-ravaged areas of New Jersey on Thursday, expressing his condolences for the lives lost and pledging federal support to help rebuild. Later in the day, he was scheduled to visit New York City to assess the aftermath of Hurricane Ida's remnants.

""I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of Hurricane Ida,"" Biden said during a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters in New Jersey. ""This is not just a New Jersey problem or a New York problem. It's an American problem.""

Biden's visit to the Northeast came a week after he traveled to Louisiana to survey the damage from Hurricane Ida's initial landfall as a powerful Category 4 storm. The hurricane caused catastrophic flooding as it moved northward, resulting in over 50 fatalities across six eastern states.

""Climate change poses an existential threat to our nation and the world,"" Biden emphasized. ""We're seeing more frequent and intense storms, more devastating wildfires, more prolonged droughts. We need to act with urgency and scale.""

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who accompanied Biden during the tour, shared his concerns about the future. ""The science is clear: Our climate is changing, and we need to adapt,"" Murphy said.

Biden has approved major disaster declarations for several counties in New Jersey and New York, paving the way for federal aid to help with recovery efforts. ""We're going to stand with you all the way,"" Biden assured the affected communities.

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki echoed the president's sentiments during a press briefing. ""The devastation wrought by Hurricane Ida is a stark reminder of the urgent need for action on climate change,"" Psaki said.

Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana on August 29, 2021, as a Category 4 storm with winds of up to 150 miles per hour (241 kilometers per hour). The storm left a trail of destruction, causing billions of dollars in damages and displacing thousands of residents.

Biden's visit to New Jersey and New York was aimed at pushing for federal spending on infrastructure to better defend against future storms. ""We need to invest in our infrastructure, not just to rebuild after a disaster, but to prevent future disasters,"" Biden said.

During his tour of flood-damaged areas in New Jersey, Biden met with emergency responders and victims of the storm. He expressed his sympathies and offered words of encouragement. ""We'll be with you every step of the way,"" Biden assured the residents.

Governor Murphy indicated that the clean-up and rebuilding process would take months. ""This is going to be a long-term recovery effort,"" Murphy said. ""But we will get through this together.""

Biden's visit to New York City was expected to include a tour of storm-damaged areas, as well as meetings with local officials and emergency responders. ""We're going to make sure New Yorkers have the resources they need to recover and rebuild,"" Biden pledged.

The remnants of Hurricane Ida brought record rainfall to the Northeast, causing widespread flooding and power outages. In New York City alone, over 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell in just a few hours.

Biden's focus on climate change and the need for urgent action comes as the United States faces an increasing number of extreme weather events. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first half of 2021 saw 20 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.

The president's call for action on climate change also includes investments in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. ""We need to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy,"" Biden said.

In Louisiana, Biden pledged $1.6 billion in federal funding to help the state recover from Hurricane Ida. He also promised to work with Congress to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill, which includes provisions for climate resilience and disaster recovery.

During his visit to New Jersey, Biden emphasized the importance of community resilience in the face of extreme weather events. ""We need to build communities that can withstand the impacts of climate change,"" Biden said.

Psaki highlighted the widespread impact of severe weather across the United States. ""We've seen devastating wildfires in the West, historic flooding in the Midwest, and now record-breaking rainfall in the Northeast,"" Psaki noted.

Biden's focus on climate change and infrastructure investments reflects a growing recognition of the need to address the root causes of extreme weather events. ""We can't just keep reacting to disasters,"" Biden said. ""We need to be proactive and invest in the future."""
548	"Tiger Woods' Crash Cause Determined by Investigators, Officials Are Unable to Disclose Due to 'Privacy Issues'

The investigation into Tiger Woods single-vehicle rollover car crash in California last month has concluded.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva revealed on Wednesday that the cause of Woods' accident ""has been determined, the investigation has concluded,"" however, they are unable to release the information to the public at the request of the golfer's team.

""We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel. ... There's some privacy issues on releasing information on the investigation so we're going to ask them if they waive the privacy and then we will be able to do a full release on all the information regarding the accident,"" Villanueva said.

He added, ""We can't release it without the people involved in the collision.""

On Feb. 23, Woods was traveling downhill when his car struck a sign in the center divider, sheared through a tree and landed in the brush alongside the road with major damage, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD).

The only additional information released about Woods' crash came earlier this month in a Los Angeles County affidavit for a search warrant of his vehicle's black box.

According to the documents obtained by CNN, Woods told police following the crash that he had no recollection of driving or how the accident happened.

Woods was also unconscious at some point after the accident, according to the affidavit, although he was conscious when sheriff's deputies arrived.

Deputy Johann Schloegl, the traffic collision investigator on the case, wrote in the affidavit that a witness who heard the crash noticed Woods was ""unconscious and not responding to his questions"" when they first approached the scene of the crash, according to CNN.

Woods' crash landed him in the hospital.

He had to undergo emergency surgery for ""significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity"" and did not return back home in Florida until mid-March.

1867	"Pence Breaks with Trump, Calls Harris to Offer Congratulations

WASHINGTON (AP) – Vice President Mike Pence called Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Tuesday to offer congratulations, marking the first known contact between the outgoing and incoming administrations.

The call comes as President Donald Trump has refused to concede defeat and has made baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. Trump has not reached out to President-elect Joe Biden or invited him to the White House.

Pence, who has distanced himself from Trump since the Capitol siege, has defended Biden's win and will attend his inauguration, unlike Trump who will skip it.

The call between Pence and Harris was described as a ""good call,"" with Pence offering his assistance.

""I congratulated her on her historic election and wished her and President-elect Biden well,"" Pence said in a statement. ""I also assured her that I would do everything in my power to ensure a smooth and orderly transition of power.""

Harris thanked Pence for his congratulations and said she looked forward to working with him during the transition.

""I am grateful for Vice President Pence's congratulations and his commitment to a smooth and orderly transition of power,"" Harris said in a statement. ""I look forward to working with him and the Biden-Harris administration to address the challenges facing our nation.""

Pence's call to Harris represents the traditional show of comity between outgoing and incoming leaders that Trump has flouted.

Biden said he would be ""honored"" to have Pence attend his inauguration, underscoring the importance of maintaining historical precedents for peaceful transfer of power.

""I think it's important that we do everything we can to make sure that the transfer of power is smooth and orderly,"" Biden said. ""And I think that's what the American people expect.""

Pence has been fulfilling ceremonial duties since the Capitol siege, including thanking National Guard members protecting the Capitol.

He has also met with foreign leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Pence's call to Harris is a sign that he is preparing for the transition of power, even as Trump continues to make baseless claims about voter fraud.

It is unclear whether Trump will eventually concede defeat and reach out to Biden.

But Pence's call to Harris is a positive step towards a peaceful and orderly transfer of power."
1378	"The Unanswered Question: What If Tom Brady Joined the Saints in 2020?

Drew Brees' decision to return for the 2020 season with the New Orleans Saints was met with both excitement and concern. On one hand, fans eagerly awaited another shot at a second Super Bowl victory. On the other hand, Brees' age and a season marred by injuries left many wondering if it was the right call. As it turns out, Brees' choice not only impacted his own journey but also potentially altered the course of NFL history.

According to ESPN reporter Jeff Darlington, speaking on 'Get Up', Tom Brady was ""very, very close"" to signing with the Saints before ultimately choosing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady's interest in the Saints was genuine, but Brees' decision to continue playing played a crucial role in the six-time Super Bowl champion's ultimate decision.

""Brady was seriously considering the Saints,"" Darlington said. ""I think it's fair to say that if Drew Brees had retired, Tom Brady would have been a New Orleans Saint.""

This hypothetical scenario raises intriguing questions about the Saints' potential success in 2020. With Brady under center, key players like Rob Gronkowski, Antonio Brown, and Leonard Fournette might have been tempted to join forces, creating a powerhouse team that could have dominated the league.

Throughout the 2020 season, Brady's health and performance metrics were significantly better than Brees'. He threw for 4,633 yards, 40 touchdowns, and only 12 interceptions, leading the Buccaneers to a Super Bowl victory. In contrast, Brees dealt with multiple injuries, including a punctured lung and multiple rib fractures, affecting his performance on the field.

While the ""what-if"" game can be endless, it's impossible to ignore the potential impact Brady could have had on the Saints' season. Could they have made a deeper playoff run? Would they have hoisted the Lombardi Trophy once again? These are questions that will forever remain unanswered.

Now, with Brees retired, the Saints have turned to former Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston as their new signal-caller. Winston, known for his big-play potential, brings a different dynamic to the Saints' offense. As the team embarks on a new era, fans and analysts alike will be watching closely to see if he can fill the void left by Brees.

For more Saints news, updates, and analysis, be sure to follow Canal Street Chronicles. The future may be uncertain, but one thing is clear: the story of the New Orleans Saints continues to unfold in fascinating ways."
212	"Citigroup Mistake Sparks Debate on Creditor Responsibilities

In a surprising turn of events, a New York federal judge has ruled that a group of creditors can keep nearly $500 million that was mistakenly transferred to them by Citigroup. The bank had intended to transfer an $8 million interest payment from Revlon to its creditors, but instead transferred nearly $900 million. After some creditors returned $400 million, 10 others refused to return the remaining $500 million, citing legal precedents and their reasonable belief that the payment was intentional due to its accuracy.

Judge Jesse Furman's ruling has sparked a debate on the responsibilities of creditors when a bank overpays. Adam Abensohn, representing the asset managers, argued that there is nothing unfair about keeping money that is owed. However, others have raised concerns about the principle of returning mistakenly sent money.

""The case poses a dilemma between the principle of returning mistakenly sent money and the right to use money repaid exactly as owed,"" said Judge Furman in his ruling. ""In this case, the creditors' reasonable belief that the payment was intentional due to its accuracy supports their decision to keep the money.""

New York law, which aims to discourage banks from making such errors, played a significant role in the judge's decision. The case has raised questions about the rules versus principles in financial transactions and has sparked a debate on the matter. DealBook is inviting reader opinions on the matter for possible inclusion in a future newsletter.

""There is no clear answer to this question, and it will be interesting to see how the courts and regulators address it in the future,"" said Adam Abensohn, representing the asset managers. ""The principle of returning mistakenly sent money is an important one, but it must be balanced against the right to use money repaid exactly as owed.""

The decision, which may be appealed by Citigroup, has highlighted the complexities of financial transactions and the need for clear rules and guidelines. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how the principle of returning mistakenly sent money will be balanced against the right to use money repaid exactly as owed.

In conclusion, the Citigroup mistake has sparked a debate on the responsibilities of creditors when a bank overpays. While the principle of returning mistakenly sent money is important, it must be balanced against the right to use money repaid exactly as owed. The case highlights the complexities of financial transactions and the need for clear rules and guidelines. DealBook invites readers to share their opinions on the matter for possible inclusion in a future newsletter."

1422	"Tiger Woods Is 'Awake,' 'Responsive' in Hospital After Car Crash

A miracle. Tiger Woods' team and a doctor gave an update on the pro golfer's condition after he was involved in a rollover car crash on Tuesday, February 23.

""We thank everyone for the overwhelming support and messages during this tough time,"" read a statement shared on Woods' Twitter account. ""As previously communicated, Tiger was involved in a single-car accident earlier this morning in California. He has undergone a long surgical procedure on his lower right leg and ankle after being brought to the hospital.""

The statement revealed that the 45-year-old is ""currently awake, responsive, and recovering in his hospital room."" It also thanked the doctors and staff at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center as well as the Los Angeles County Sheriff's and Fire Departments for their ""outstanding"" support and assistance.

""Mr. Woods suffered significant orthopaedic injuries to his right lower extremity that were treated during emergency surgery by Orthopaedic trauma specialists at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center,"" the hospital's chief medical officer and interim CEO, Dr. Anish Mahajan, said in a statement. ""Comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones were stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia. Additional injuries to the bones of the foot and ankle were stabilized with a combination of screws and pins. Trauma to the muscle and soft-tissue of the leg required surgical release of the covering of the muscles to relive pressure due to swelling.""

Woods was rushed to the hospital earlier on Tuesday after his SUV made contact with a center median, crossed into oncoming traffic, hit a curb and a tree and rolled over several times on the border of Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes, California.

The sheriff's department initially said that the athlete ""was extricated from the wreck with the 'jaws of life'"" before fire chief Daryl Osby clarified that firefighters had used an ax and other tools to pry open the vehicle.

Sheriff's deputy Carlos Gonzalez said during a press conference on Tuesday that Woods ""seemed as though he was lucid and calm"" when first responders arrived at the scene of the accident. Sheriff Alex Villaneuva, meanwhile, told reporters that Woods' vehicle had traveled at ""a relatively greater speed than normal.""

The five-time Masters Tournament champion was wearing his seat belt when he crashed, and Villaneuva said the airbags in Woods' car ""gave him the cushion to survive what otherwise would have been a fatal crash.""

Woods has undergone five back surgeries since 2014, most recently in December 2020. Prior to Tuesday's accident, he said that he had hoped to return to golf this year."
1782	"Bucs Super Bowl Plan Relied on 'Run-Action' | Another Next Gen Look at Super Bowl LV

Prior to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Wild Card game at Washington in early January, Offensive Coordinator Byron Leftwich was asked how his crew would handle a strong defense that featured one of the league's best pass-rushing fronts. Leftwich's response, in part, was this:

""I've got to put these guys in position to do the things that they need to do to give ourselves an opportunity to win the football game.""

Leftwich shared that thought, in some form or another, many times during the 2020 season, which ended with the Buccaneers hoisting the Lombardi Trophy after a Super Bowl LV victory over Kansas City. Essentially, he's saying that he and the coaching staff have to devise a game plan that would counter the opposing defense's strengths and take advantage of its weaknesses, and then it was up to the players to execute it. Like most coordinators, Leftwich didn't feel the need to share what that game plan was before the game itself took place.

The Buccaneers had an offensive game plan for the Chiefs now seems very clear in retrospect. It centered on effective play-action fakes and getting the ball out of Tom Brady's hand quickly. Thanks to good execution of that plan by the players, it worked. The result was a smooth and mistake-free offense that, at one point, scored on five of six consecutive drives, with the other one ending at Kansas City's one-yard line. The result was a dominant 31-9 win and the second championship in franchise history.

The heavy usage of play-action in the passing game was pretty easy to spot during the game and later confirmed by NFL Next Gen Stats. According to Next Gen, Brady executed a play-action fake on 43% of his dropbacks. Next Gen has been tracking this and many other things since 2016 and that is the single-highest rate of play-action usage that Brady has had in a game in that span.

This was the plan right from the start, and it was a new one. As a team, the Buccaneers either ran the ball or faked a handoff – what Next Gen Stats calls ""run action"" – on 73% of their plays in the first quarter, their highest rate in any game this season. Over the season as a whole, the Bucs used run action on just 48% of their first-quarter plays.

Brady ended up throwing 13 passes after a fake handoff and he completed 10 of them for 135 yards and all three of his touchdowns. Those numbers produce a near-perfect passer rating of 149.0. Obviously, those fakes are meant to move defenders in the wrong direction, and that's exactly what they did. At the point of the catch or incompletion, Brady's targeted pass-catchers had an average of 4.0 yards of separation from the nearest defender. That's the best average separation the Buccaneers got in any game during the entire 2020 season."
2016	"Trump Faces Unprecedented Second Impeachment for Inciting Violence Against US Government

CNN – Washington D.C. – In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump is facing a second impeachment for inciting violence against the U.S. government. The House of Representatives is expected to hold a vote on impeachment this week, with the Senate trial taking place after Trump leaves office.

This impeachment accusation marks the first time Trump has been accused of inciting violence against another branch of government. The Constitution mandates impeachment for ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""

Democrats allege that Trump incited violence by denying the results of the 2020 presidential election and pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" votes. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has offered alternatives to impeachment, but these have not been taken, leading to rapid impeachment proceedings.

The House can impeach Trump with a simple majority, and fast action is expected without extended investigations. The Senate trial might be conducted on a half-day basis to allow time for other legislative activities.

If convicted, Trump could be barred from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the U.S. A second impeachment conviction could also affect Trump's ability to run for office in 2024 and might impact his pension.

Trump's first impeachment in 2019 was for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, related to his dealings with Ukraine. He was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020.

The second impeachment accusation comes as Trump faces mounting pressure over his efforts to overturn the election results. Last week, Trump called Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and pressured him to ""find"" enough votes to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state.

The call was recorded, and a transcript was released by the Washington Post. In the call, Trump can be heard telling Raffensperger, ""I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.""

Raffensperger refused to comply with Trump's request, saying that the election results were certified and couldn't be changed. Trump has also made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, which have been rejected by election officials and fact-checkers.

The impeachment process began on Monday, with the House Judiciary Committee debating the articles of impeachment. The committee is expected to vote on the articles this week, followed by a full House vote.

The impeachment process has been fast-tracked, with Democrats pushing for a quick vote before Trump leaves office on January 20. The Senate trial is expected to take place in the coming weeks, with a conviction requiring a two-thirds majority.

Trump has denied any wrongdoing, calling the impeachment a ""hoax"" and a ""witch hunt."" His supporters have also defended him, saying that he was simply trying to ensure the integrity of the election.

However, critics argue that Trump's actions are a threat to democracy and the rule of law. They say that his efforts to overturn the election results undermine the legitimacy of the electoral process and could lead to violence and unrest.

The impeachment process has been divisive, with many Americans split over whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office. Protests have erupted across the country, with some calling for Trump's impeachment and others defending him.

The impeachment process has also raised questions about the role of the president and the limits of executive power. Some argue that Trump's actions are a violation of his oath of office and that he has abused his power.

Others say that the impeachment process is a political tool being used by Democrats to undermine Trump's presidency. They argue that the allegations against Trump are unfounded and that the impeachment process is a waste of time and resources.

Regardless of the outcome, the impeachment process is likely to have far-reaching consequences for Trump and the country. A conviction could bar Trump from holding public office again, while an acquittal could embolden him to continue his controversial policies.

The impeachment process has also highlighted the deep divisions within the country, with many Americans polarized over political issues. It remains to be seen how the process will play out and what the impact will be on the country's political landscape.

In conclusion, President Donald Trump is facing an unprecedented second impeachment for inciting violence against the U.S. government. The impeachment process has been fast-tracked, with a House vote expected this week and a Senate trial taking place after Trump leaves office. The outcome of the impeachment process could have far-reaching consequences for Trump and the country, and it remains to be seen how it will play out."
566	"Suez Canal Blockage: A Wake-Up Call on Climate Change and Supply Chain Vulnerability

The recent six-day blockage of the Suez Canal by the colossal Ever Given container ship has sent shockwaves through the global economy, highlighting the fragility of our interconnected supply chains and the potential implications of extreme weather events in an era of climate change. While the precise cause of the incident remains under investigation, meteorological analysis suggests that strong winds and a sandstorm, likely exacerbated by climate change-induced heatwaves, played a significant role in creating challenging navigation conditions.

The Suez Canal Blockage: A Timeline of Events

On March 23, 2021, the Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, became wedged across the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The massive vessel, carrying over 20,000 containers, blocked all traffic through the canal, causing a massive backlog of ships and disrupting global trade.

Initially, high winds and a sandstorm were cited as the primary causes of the incident, reducing visibility and making navigation difficult. However, subsequent statements from Egyptian authorities and maritime experts indicated that other factors, such as the ship's speed and navigational challenges, may have also contributed to the grounding.

The Role of Extreme Weather in the Suez Canal Blockage

Meteorological analysis of the weather conditions at the time of the incident suggests that strong south-southeasterly winds, known as khamsin winds, played a significant role in pushing the Ever Given off course and grounding it on the canal's bank. These winds are common in the region during the spring and are known for their strength and ability to create dust storms.

Complicating the situation was a recent heatwave in Egypt, with temperatures reaching near-record highs. The heat and dry conditions likely contributed to the formation of the sandstorm that further reduced visibility and made navigation even more challenging.

Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events

While there is no direct evidence linking the Suez Canal blockage to climate change, the incident raises important questions about the potential correlations between extreme weather events and disruptions to global trade and supply chains.

Climate change is leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms. These events can have devastating impacts on infrastructure, transportation, and agriculture, potentially disrupting supply chains and causing economic losses.

The Vulnerability of Global Supply Chains

The Suez Canal blockage has exposed the vulnerability of global supply chains to disruptions caused by extreme weather events. The just-in-time shipping model, which relies on the timely delivery of goods, is particularly susceptible to these disruptions.

The blockage of the Suez Canal, a critical chokepoint for global trade, caused a massive backlog of ships and delayed the delivery of goods worldwide. This disruption had a ripple effect on businesses and consumers, highlighting the need for more resilient and diversified supply chains.

Ongoing Investigations and Lessons Learned

Investigations into the Suez Canal blockage are ongoing, with a focus on understanding the complex interplay of factors that led to the grounding of the Ever Given. These factors include weather conditions, vessel speed, navigational challenges, and the design of the Suez Canal itself.

The incident has prompted calls for a review of safety protocols and navigation procedures in the Suez Canal, as well as a broader assessment of the resilience of global supply chains to extreme weather events.

Conclusion

The Suez Canal blockage serves as a wake-up call on the potential impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on global trade and supply chains. While the precise cause of the incident remains under investigation, the meteorological analysis suggests that strong winds and a sandstorm, likely exacerbated by climate change-induced heatwaves, played a significant role in creating challenging navigation conditions.

The incident highlights the need for more resilient and diversified supply chains, as well as a broader assessment of the risks posed by extreme weather events in an era of climate change. By understanding the complex interplay of factors that led to the Suez Canal blockage, we can take steps to mitigate the risks and ensure the smooth flow of global trade in the face of future challenges."
526	"FDA Authorizes Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged 5 Through 11

In a significant advancement in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children aged 5 through 11 years. This milestone marks a crucial step forward in our efforts to safeguard our youngest population and reduce the spread of COVID-19 within our communities.

The vaccine's effectiveness was determined to be 90.7% in preventing COVID-19 in the specified age group, providing robust protection against the virus. This promising outcome is based on comprehensive clinical trials and rigorous scientific review, underscoring the vaccine's significant role in combating the current pandemic.

Regarding safety considerations, approximately 3,100 children in the 5 through 11 age group participated in the initial part of the study. No serious side effects were detected, highlighting the vaccine's safety profile for this younger population. This reassurance about the vaccine's safety comes at a critical time as we seek to protect our children from COVID-19 while ensuring their well-being.

The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to discuss further recommendations on the vaccine's use for children aged 5 through 11 next week. Their guidance will play a pivotal role in shaping the vaccine's rollout to this crucial age group.

Notably, the vaccine for children aged 5 through 11 will be administered as a two-dose series, three weeks apart, with a lower dose than the one used for individuals aged 12 and older. This age-specific dosing strategy ensures the vaccine's safety and efficacy for younger children.

COVID-19 cases among children aged 5 through 11 represent a significant portion of the total cases in younger populations, accounting for 39% of cases in individuals under the age of 18 in the United States. This statistic underscores the vital need for vaccination within this age group.

Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner, remarked, ""Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy. Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine's safety and effectiveness should reassure parents and guardians about the robustness of our authorization process.""

Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, emphasized, ""The FDA's authorization of this vaccine for children aged 5 through 11 is a testament to our commitment to ensuring the vaccines meet our high standards for quality, effectiveness, and safety. Transparency in our review process is vital to maintaining public trust, and we assure families that we have thoroughly scrutinized the data.""

In line with the EUA, Pfizer Inc. has been authorized to use a new vaccine formulation with a Tris buffer, enhancing the vaccine's stability and storage conditions. The company has also revised its safety monitoring plans to include continued evaluations of myocarditis and pericarditis, among other safety measures. Both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have robust systems in place for continuous safety monitoring of the COVID-19 vaccine, ensuring ongoing oversight of the vaccine's use in the population."
1171	"Did Cargo Ship 'Draw' a Penis Before Getting Stuck in Suez Canal?

Claim: An image showing the route of the Ever Given cargo ship before it got stuck in the Suez Canal resembled a crude drawing of a penis. Rating: About this rating Mostly True Context This is a genuine image showing the route of the Ever Given cargo ship as it waited its turn to enter the Suez Canal. However, as of this writing, there's no evidence that this ship intentionally took this route in order to make a funny GPS drawing.

On March 23, 2021, shipping traffic through Egypt's Suez Canal was grounded to a halt after a large vessel called the ""Ever Given"" got stuck in the passageway. Shortly after news broke about this blocked shipping route, an image started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed how the Ever Given, a nearly 200-foot wide, 224,000-ton vessel, had ""drawn"" a penis in its route movements shortly before it entered the Suez Canal:

This is a genuine image showing the Ever Given's route before it got stuck in the Suez Canal. While it may resemble a rough drawing of a penis, there's no evidence to indicate that this was ""drawn"" on purpose.

The image comes from a video created by the vessel-trafficking service provider VesselFinder.com. The video shows the movements of the Ever Given as it waited for its turn to enter the Suez Canal. Vessel Finder wrote:

On the occasion of the disputed incident of the ultra-large container ship Ever Given blocking the Suez Canal, the VesselFinder team made a video simulation of the movements of the ship in more detail, for some time before it got stuck in the canal and blocked the main artery of cargo flow between Asia and Europe.

Here's the video:

While some social media users may have been skeptical of this image, thinking that it was just a crude joke, a spokesperson for Vesselfinder.com confirmed to Vice that the route was genuine, adding that ""there is no room for some kind of conspiracies or false data.""

Another map from the ship-tracking website Myshiptracking.com also shows the Ever Given's seemingly NSFW route.

CNN reported on March 24 that eight tugboats were working to free the vessel, but that it could be days before the Suez Canal, one of the world's busiest shipping routes, returns to normal traffic levels:"
501	"Why 'Rust' Producers May Choose Bankruptcy Next

Who believes that Rust — the Alec Baldwin movie that suspended production a week ago after the fatal shooting of the film's cinematographer on a New Mexico set — will eventually be completed and released? The question isn't the most important one following the accidental tragedy. Yet, it does inform the calculus on what's to come.

Most observers may not care about the millions of dollars put into this indie film. Very few are considering what it would be like for anyone in the cast and crew to get back on set and finish a Western that was reportedly about halfway through production before the Oct. 21 accident. Instead, most news stories that do point toward the future are speculating about the possibility of criminal charges and the potential for civil lawsuits. Producers for the film have hired Brandon Fox at Jenner & Block to handle an investigation.

""If the facts and evidence and law support charges, then I will initiate prosecution at that time,"" Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said at a press conference on Wednesday. ""I do not make rash decisions and cannot rush to judgment.""

But the choice to finish or abandon the film could very well play a role on how this all shakes out. All productions begin with several rounds of risk assessment. Investors must look at the prospect of recouping, while even the most optimistic producers take out insurance in case anything goes wrong.

Rust was no exception, and the film insurance policy will likely cover at least part of the tab for the shutdown and probably even the costs for defending and settling negligence claims. (Some insurers exclude gross negligence. That's a whole other discussion.) But there's certainly a limit, and that's why many banks that lend money for film and television production insist upon a completion bond.

Also called a completion guarantee, completion bonds act almost like umbrella insurance policies to fill in any gaps and get the production to the finish line.

Multiple sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Rust had trouble obtaining a completion bond, which isn't unusual as premiums can be expensive — and which has become even less unusual amid the pandemic and its attendant production shutdowns.

A rep for Rust did not refute THR's sources and pointed to a statement that read: ""We have halted production on the film for an undetermined period of time and are fully cooperating with all investigations and inquiries.""

But if the film had trouble obtaining a completion bond, the absence of a financial savior also means that those with a stake in the Rust enterprise — those who put up money (the budget was reportedly $7 million to $8 million), those owed money — may eye whatever is left in the bank account plus any meager insurance proceeds and attempt to position themselves for an exit. Especially with civil claims looming, too."
2139	"Donald Trump Takes on Tech Giants with Class-Action Lawsuits Over Social Media Bans

Former US President Donald Trump has launched a legal offensive against Facebook, Twitter, and Google, filing class-action lawsuits against the tech behemoths and their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai. The suits, which aim to restore Trump's access to his social media accounts and seek punitive damages, represent a significant escalation in the ongoing battle between Trump and the platforms that suspended him following the January 6 Capitol riot.

The legal effort is being led by John P. Coale, a seasoned trial attorney known for his involvement in high-profile cases against big tobacco companies. Speaking about the lawsuits, Coale stated, ""We're taking on the Goliaths of the tech world. This is about free speech and holding these companies accountable for their actions.""

In the aftermath of the Capitol riot, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube indefinitely suspended Trump's accounts, citing concerns over the potential for further incitement of violence. Trump's absence from these platforms has significantly impacted his online presence, despite his efforts to increase public activities through alternative channels.

The lawsuits challenge Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a provision that shields tech companies from liability for content posted by their users. By attempting to label social media companies as government actors, Trump's legal team argues that they should be held accountable for alleged censorship.

Susan Wojcicki, YouTube's Chief Executive, has previously defended the platform's decision to ban Trump, stating, ""Our policies apply to everyone, regardless of their political views or who they are."" Similarly, tech companies and advocacy groups have rejected Trump's claims, asserting that the First Amendment protects their right to moderate content on their platforms.

Steve DelBianco, CEO of NetChoice, a trade association representing e-commerce businesses, criticized the lawsuits, emphasizing the First Amendment's role in protecting media companies from government interference. ""The First Amendment protects social media companies from the president, not the other way around,"" DelBianco said.

In a recent development, a federal judge in Florida blocked a state law that would have prevented social media platforms from banning political candidates. The ruling could have implications for Trump's case, as it underscores the legal challenges faced by attempts to regulate how private companies manage their platforms.

The lawsuits mark a new chapter in the ongoing debate over the power and responsibility of social media companies in regulating online speech. As the legal battle unfolds, the outcome will likely have far-reaching consequences for the future of content moderation and the relationship between tech giants and political figures."
546	"Alleged Threats Against Colorado Springs Schools Deemed Uncredible

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) – Alleged threats circulating on social media targeting Chinook Trail Middle School and Chinook Trail Elementary School in Colorado Springs were deemed uncredible by authorities, according to statements released on Thursday. The two schools, which share a campus on the northeast side of the city, were at the center of concerns raised by parents and students following the widespread dissemination of ominous messages online.

Allison Cortez, a spokesperson for Academy District 20, confirmed that the Colorado Springs Police Department had identified the students allegedly involved in the social media threats and after thorough investigation found no credible danger to the schools. ""The safety and security of our students and staff remain our top priority,"" Cortez assured, urging families to communicate directly with the district regarding any concerns.

In light of the unsettling situation, parents were given the option to keep their children home from school, even though officials emphasized that both Chinook Trail Middle and Elementary Schools would remain open and under heightened security measures. Lt. James Sokolik of the Colorado Springs Police Department reassured the community, stating, ""We take all threats seriously and are committed to ensuring the safety of all students and staff members.""

Principal Tom Andrew of Chinook Trail Middle School echoed the district's sentiment, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a safe and supportive learning environment despite the challenges posed by external factors. ""Our focus remains on education and ensuring the well-being of our students,"" Andrew stated, encouraging open communication between school administration and parents regarding safety concerns.

Similarly, Pat Schumaker, principal of Chinook Trail Elementary School, emphasized the collaborative efforts between the schools, law enforcement, and the community to address and dispel the perceived threats. ""We are grateful for the swift action taken by the Colorado Springs Police Department and school officials to investigate these concerns thoroughly,"" Schumaker said.

The recent uptick in school threats has been linked to heightened anxieties caused by recent national incidents, such as the tragic shooting at a high school in Michigan. Authorities underscored the importance of vigilant monitoring and coordination between schools and law enforcement agencies to ensure a swift and effective response to any potential risks.

Despite the efforts to address the situation promptly, misinformation and rumor spreading on social media platforms complicated the police investigation. Lt. Sokolik expressed frustration over the proliferation of inaccurate information, citing instances where outdated photos were misinterpreted as current threats and baseless claims of a 'hit list' circulated among students.

To combat the dissemination of false information, authorities urged the public to report any incidents or suspicions through official channels like Safe2Tell, rather than relying on social media platforms. Lt. Sokolik stressed, ""It is crucial that we receive accurate and timely information to assess and address any potential threats to our schools.""

As the community grapples with the aftermath of these unsettling events, school officials reiterated their commitment to ensuring a safe and secure learning environment for all students. The resilience and collaboration demonstrated in response to the alleged threats serve as a testament to the dedication of both educators and law enforcement officers in safeguarding the well-being of the community's youth."

911	"Facebook Suspends Donald Trump for Two Years, Citing Severe Violation of Rules

In a stunning move, Facebook has suspended former President Donald Trump's account for two years, citing a severe violation of its rules following the Capitol riots. The decision has sparked controversy and debate, with some hailing it as a necessary measure to prevent further violence, while others see it as an attack on free speech.

According to Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, Trump's actions were a severe violation deserving of the highest penalty. ""We have a responsibility to protect public safety and prevent further violence on our platform,"" Clegg said in a statement. ""Donald Trump's actions were a clear violation of our rules, and we cannot allow him to continue to use our services to incite hatred and violence.""

The suspension comes just in time for the 2024 election cycle, with Trump's reinstatement depending on a public safety risk assessment. Trump condemned Facebook's decision, calling it an insult and hinting at no ""dinners"" with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he's re-elected. ""This is a clear attempt by Facebook to silence my voice and punish me for speaking the truth,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I will not be silenced, and I will continue to fight for the American people.""

The Biden White House doubts Trump's behavioral change post-suspension, emphasizing responsibility on platforms to control misinformation. ""Social media platforms have a critical role to play in preventing the spread of misinformation and promoting a safe and secure online environment,"" said White House press secretary Jennifer Psaki. ""We welcome Facebook's decision to suspend Donald Trump's account, but we also recognize that more needs to be done to address the root causes of violence and extremism online.""

Facebook's decision alters its policy to stop granting politicians exemptions from content rules, introducing penalties for fomenting violence. ""We cannot continue to allow politicians to use our platform to incite violence and hatred without consequence,"" said Clegg. ""We must hold all users accountable for their actions, regardless of their political status.""

The suspension limits Trump's fundraising capabilities for the 2022 Republican candidates, a move that has been met with criticism from both political spectrums. ""This is a blatant attempt to silence a political opponent and stifle free speech,"" said Bret Jacobson, president of the digital advocacy agency for conservatives Red Edge. ""Trump's suspension is a violation of his First Amendment rights, and we will not stand for it.""

Others, however, see the suspension as a necessary measure to prevent further violence and extremism. ""Social media platforms have a responsibility to protect their users from harmful content, and Facebook's decision to suspend Trump is a step in the right direction,"" said Madihha Ahussain, senior policy counsel at Muslim Advocates. ""We must hold all users accountable for their actions, regardless of their political status or social status.""

The suspension decision followed a directive from Facebook's Oversight Board, which deemed an indefinite suspension inappropriate. ""We must balance free speech with public safety, and Facebook's decision to suspend Trump for two years strikes the right balance,"" said Clegg. ""We will continue to work with our users and the public to ensure that our platform is a safe and secure environment for all.""

In conclusion, Facebook's decision to suspend Donald Trump's account for two years has sparked controversy and debate, with some hailing it as a necessary measure to prevent further violence, while others see it as an attack on free speech. Regardless of one's political views, it is clear that social media platforms have a responsibility to protect their users from harmful content, and Facebook's decision to suspend Trump is a step in the right direction towards achieving that goal."
254	"Trial of Wisconsin teen for protest shooting delayed by 7 months

The trial for Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old man accused of killing two people and wounding a third during a protest against police brutality in Wisconsin, was deferred on Wednesday by seven months and could be delayed even longer as court cases resulting from the last year's Black Lives Matter protests unfold in the United States.

Rittenhouse's trial was scheduled to begin on March 29, but both sides told Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder that they needed more time to prepare. The judge set November 1 as the new date to begin the trial, with a May 17 status hearing.

Rittenhouse faces multiple felony counts, including reckless homicide and reckless endangerment. He also faces a misdemeanour count of being a minor in possession of a firearm.

Rittenhouse appeared with his lawyer during the court hearing broadcast over Zoom. He spoke only when the judge asked him if he had any problem with the delay, which would push his trial start to more than a year after the shootings.

""No, your honour,"" Rittenhouse said. He was seated behind his lawyer, wearing a mask. The judge cautioned that the trial could be pushed even further, saying the November date was ""not written in stone"".

Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said both sides needed more time, citing a ""number of outstanding issues"", including DNA testing.

Rittenhouse's lawyer, Mark Richards, agreed to the November trial start.

""We're interested in moving this matter forward but whatever the court decides, we'll abide by,"" he said.

Legal reckoning

According to prosecutors, Rittenhouse, who is white, travelled to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, on August 25 after a local militia posted an online message seeking help protecting businesses from protesters. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic protests after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, who is Black, in the back during a domestic disturbance. The shooting left Blake paralysed from the waist down.

Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, opened fire on protesters Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz with an AR-15-style rifle. Rosenbaum and Huber died, while Grosskreutz survived with wounds.

Grosskreutz and his lawyer also attended the hearing but did not speak.

Rittenhouse has argued that he fired in self-defence after the three protesters attacked him. Police let him walk through their lines in the moments following the shootings, even though Rittenhouse still had his rifle slung over his shoulder and protesters were screaming that he had just shot three people.

Conservatives have rallied around him, painting him as a symbol for gun rights. They generated $2m for his bail in November.

Black Lives Matter supporters have worked to define him as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Richards told Schroeder last month that Rittenhouse has received threats and has moved into an undisclosed safe house.

The delay comes as courts begin to deal with the legal ramifications of the BLM movement.

Jury selection began on Monday in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with the murder of George Floyd.

Floyd's death, which occurred while Chauvin's knee was on his neck, sparked national protests.

The trial of Andrea Sahouri, an Iowa journalist arrested while covering the protests and charged with failure to disperse and interfering with official acts, also began on Monday.

Kenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor's boyfriend at the time of her death, was cleared of all charges related to the shooting of a police officer during the botched raid that killed Taylor, also on Monday.

Taylor's name, along with Floyd's and others, were mentioned at BLM protests during the summer."
542	"Biden Vows Retaliation After Kabul Airport Attack and Says Evacuation Won't Be Deterred: 'We Will Hunt You'

Following a deadly bombing and gun attack by Islamic State fighters outside the airport in Afghanistan's capital on Thursday, President Joe Biden said the United States would ""not forget"" those who lost their lives and would ""hunt"" those responsible.

In a speech from the White House, Biden, 78, addressed the ""evolving"" situation, saying that he was ""constantly being updated"" as he called the Americans who died ""heroes"" — ""Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.""

Officials say 13 U.S. service members and dozens of Afghans were killed in the ""heinous attack"" outside Kabul's airport.

Large crowds have for weeks gathered around the airport as tens of thousands of people are being evacuated amid the American military withdrawal and Taliban takeover.

Pentagon officials said Thursday that the bombing was at a gate leading into the airport, likely while the attackers were being physically screened by U.S. troops providing security for the evacuations.

In his speech, President Biden lauded the service members as ""part of the bravest, most capable and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the 'backbone of America.' They're the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.""

He offered condolences from himself and his wife, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, and led a moment of silence for the victims.

Directing his message to those responsible — believed to be a branch of the Islamic State opposed to the U.S. and the Taliban — as well as ""anyone who wishes America harm,"" the president warned:

""We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.""

""We will not be deterred by terrorists,"" Biden said, adding, ""We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation. ... America will not be intimidated.""

The White House subsequently said Friday morning that another 12,500 people had left the country through the airport between Thursday and Friday morning.

The U.S.-led evacuation, after initially facing widespread criticism as too slow and clumsy, expanded rapidly since mid-August, which officials have touted as an enormous logistical feat.

On Thursday afternoon, shortly before Biden's speech, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. said during a press conference that the military had been bracing for an attack and was prepared for future violence — but that would not stop them from more evacuations.

McKenzie said then that a suicide bomber had struck the Abbey Gate, one of the entry points to Kabul's airport, after which Islamic State gunmen opened fire on the military and civilians.

The working assessment was the bomber, having already passed through other checkpoints en route to the airport, detonated themselves as they were being screened by American forces to enter the gate, McKenzie said.

Asked how the assailants could have made it through the layers of security, McKenzie — who is head of U.S. Central Command — said, ""It was a failure somewhere.""

McKenzie also confirmed the number of American troops killed during the press conference and said 15 others were wounded, along with civilians. The troops killed included 11 Marines and a Navy medic, according to the Associated Press."
1722	"'I wouldn't want my worst enemy to go through this': Mississippi woman cares for her unvaccinated husband battling Covid-19

CNN — With the rise of Covid-19 cases due to the more contagious Delta variant, evidence continues to mount that vaccination is the key to prevent serious coronavirus illness.

For one Mississippi couple who caught Covid-19, their outcomes provide a growing contrast. The wife, who is vaccinated, recovered after 10 days. But her unvaccinated husband has been in the hospital for 22 days and counting.

""He's just trying so hard to get better and get home,"" Alicia Ball said about her husband, William, whose currently in an intensive care unit battling Covid-19. ""We have a lot of people praying for us.

""He means so much to our family. He's the rock of our family.""

At times holding back tears, she told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday that she is ""emotionally and mentally and physically exhausted.""

Ball spoke to CNN from a hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, with her husband lying beside her in bed with an oxygen mask on. He is currently not on a ventilator.

""It's real. It's devastating. ... It's been really hard,"" she said. ""I wouldn't want my worst enemy to go through this.""

Ball added she and her husband were vaccine-hesitant, but she eventually got the vaccine under her doctor's care after fears regarding her asthma condition. She said she fell ill for 10 days when she contracted Covid-19 and had to visit an emergency room.

Ball said her vaccine skepticism stemmed from not knowing just how badly the virus can affect her.

""We just didn't know the severity of the disease ... especially, this Delta variant. ... It just hadn't hit that close to home, yet,"" she said.

Mississippi has one of the nation's lowest vaccination rates, with 34.4% of the total population fully vaccinated, state data shows.

The state is also designated as an area with high transmission of Covid-19, according to federal health data. Over the past week, Mississippi saw 336 cases per 100,000 people, which is one of the highest rates in the US.

The Delta variant of Covid-19 has been spreading throughout the country, compounding concerns among health officials. Safety restrictions and mask guidances are making a return as cases rose by at least 10% in nearly every US state in the last week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The variant spreads quicker and more easily than the first coronavirus strain and can infect fully vaccinated people whose symptoms are usually milder.

Ball hopes sharing her Covid-19 experience will encourage her loved ones and others to get vaccinated.

""God, I hope so. I hope it's helped our family, our church, our friends, anybody that sees this broadcast. I hope it helps. That's why I'm doing it,"" she said."
2107	"QAnon shaman Jacob Chansley sentenced to 41 months in prison for Jan. 6 Capitol riot case

""QAnon shaman"" Jacob Chansley, one of the most notorious figures of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, was sentenced Wednesday to three years and five months in prison for his role in the invasion of the halls of Congress by a horde of Trump supporters. ""What you did was terrible,"" said Judge Royce Lamberth in federal court in Washington, D.C., even as he called Chansley's stated remorse for his crime genuine. ""What you did was so serious that I cannot justify a"" sentence lower than what was suggested by federal sentencing guidelines, Lamberth said. But Chanlsey's sentence was on the low end of the range of 41 months to 51 months in prison that were suggested by those guidelines. However, it also is tied for the longest sentence issued to date for any of the Capitol riot defendants who have pleaded guilty. ""I was wrong for entering the Capitol. I have no excuse. No excuse whatsoever,"" Chansley told Lamberth. ""The behavior is indefensible."""
1367	"Tennessee man pleads guilty to minor protesting charge in U.S. Capitol riot case

A Tennessee man has pleaded guilty to a minor protesting charge related to the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Bryan Wayne Ivey admitted to knowingly entering restricted areas of the Capitol in a videoconference plea hearing Tuesday.

Ivey pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing inside Capitol grounds. On top of possible prison time, a fine or probation, Ivey agreed to pay $500 in restitution to the United States.

The 28-year-old Crossville man, born in Gallatin, was arrested March 4 in Tennessee on four charges related to the riot. The remaining charges were dropped Tuesday as part of his plea agreement.

A tipster told the FBI they recognized Ivey in a still photo of a video posted to social media, court documents show. In the photo, Ivey appeared to be breaking a window at the Capitol with a riot shield.

If the case had gone to trial, prosecutors would have presented evidence that Ivey in fact watched another protester do the damage, Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C. Leslie Goemaat said in court Tuesday.

""He joined a large crowd around the Capitol. After the police lined the streets, he approached and watched another rioter break a window at the Capitol using a riot shield. The defendant then entered the U.S. Capitol,"" she said.

Ivey's wife and brother also traveled to Washington, D.C., with him but did not enter the Capitol, according to statements made in his initial appearance before a judge in March.

A sentencing hearing has been set for Sept. 28 in front of Washington, D.C. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper. The charge carries possible sentences of up to six months in prison, a fine of up to $5,000 and/or probation for up to one year.

Ivey's attorney, Middle Tennessee public defender Robert David Baker, told the judge he planned to present mitigating factors related to the sentence at the September hearing.

The tipster told the FBI that a close contact of Ivey's said he told them he was in the building on Jan. 6.

In photos released by the U.S. Attorney's Office in March, Ivey was identified as a man wearing a brown hat, brown jacket and sunglasses in the image. The tipster said they also recognized Ivey's voice captured in video from the scene.

Ivey originally faced four charges:

Knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority;

disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds;

disorderly conduct in a capitol building;

parading, demonstrating or picketing in a capitol building.

At least 15 people with Tennessee ties have been charged in connection to the riot. A massive investigation continues."
394	"Now that Rittenhouse is not guilty, can Norfolk Police Officer Kelly have his job back?

The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse produced a number of immediate changes beyond the custodial status of the 18-year-old himself.

GoFundMe lifted its ban on people contributing to his defense – after his defense was over and the verdict was in. Some media outlets finally reported on evidence that supported his self-defense claims and one critic called for ""revisiting"" the clearly biased reporting in the case.

KYLE RITTENHOUSE RECOUNTS KENOSHA RIOTS, REACTS TO MEDIA PORTRAYAL OF TRIAL IN FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE ACQUITTAL

However, there is one person whose status has not changed: Norfolk Police Officer William Kelly, who was fired for simply donating to the Rittenhouse defense fund and writing a supportive note as a private citizen. He made the comment and donation anonymously. The only thing more shocking than Kelly's loss of his job is that Norfolk City Manager Chip Filer and Police Chief Larry Boone have retained theirs.

I criticized the firing of Kelly last April as a blatant attack on free speech. The termination occurred after Kelly made a $25 donation to the defense of Kyle Rittenhouse. He made the donation anonymously and added the comment ""God Bless. Thank you for your courage. Keep your head up. You've done nothing wrong. Every rank-and-file police officer supports you.""

Early in the Rittenhouse case, activists sought to cut off Rittenhouse's ability to raise money for his defense by harassing donors and (successfully) pressuring companies like GoFundMe to block contributions.

A criminal defense in any case (let alone a high-profile case with ramped up prosecution teams) is hugely expensive. That financial threat can prompt some to plead guilty. That is why people want to help fund such defenses to guarantee true access to a fair trial. Activists and GoFundMe did everything they could to block such efforts and increase the pressure on this teenager to just plead guilty.

Back to Kelly. This is an officer who had served for almost 20 years when he contributed to the defense. As a police officer, Kelly likely saw the defense grounds more clearly than most people. The jury ultimately agreed with his view that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.

Nevertheless, activists learned his identity and demanded his termination. City Manager Filer rushed to satisfy the mob. He fired Kelly with the support of Police Chief Boone and declared ""his egregious comments erode the trust between the Norfolk Police Department and those they are sworn to serve.""

Keep in mind the ""egregious comments,"" that there are officers who support Rittenhouse and believe in his defense, were said anonymously. Kelly has pointed out that Boone was allowed in uniform to publicly march with Black Lives Matter protesters. Yet, he was fired for anonymously making a supportive donation and a statement to a legal defense fund.

Various public officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have contributed to the The Minnesota Freedom Fund, which ""pays criminal bail and immigration bonds for those who cannot otherwise afford to as we seek to end discriminatory, coercive, and oppressive jailing.""

The vice president and others have the right to support such legal defense funds, which aim to ensure litigants have the means to defend themselves. So does Kelly.

When Kelly was fired, many on the left celebrated despite the fact that he was being denied his rights to free speech and free association. It is a pattern I have written about in the past as public employees are fired for statements on social media or associations in their private lives.

This includes a New Jersey police officer fired for calling BLM protesters ""terrorists"" on her personal Facebook account. Most recently, a court reinstated Loudoun teacher Byron ""Tanner"" Cross, who was fired for speaking publicly against gender identification policies.

As it stands, Kelly was fired for supporting (again, anonymously) a teenager who was ultimately acquitted of all charges by a jury. He was fired for contributing to a legal fund that would help the accused put on a full defense. That is in the interest of justice.

Yet, Filer and Boone remain employed despite using their official positions to retaliate against a public employee using his constitutional right to free speech. Kelly and his family continue to appeal his firing as they struggle to survive on the teacher's salary of his wife.

The dictator Idi Amin once proclaimed ""There is freedom of speech, but I cannot guarantee freedom after speech."" That seems the standard applied in Norfolk, where even anonymous support for a legal defense is grounds for termination."
1699	"Hypocrisy in High Places: Adults Undermining the Values We Teach Our Children

As adults, we have a responsibility to set a good example for the children in our lives. We teach them about the importance of fairness, empathy, and respect for others. Yet, all too often, the actions of our public figures contradict the values we espouse.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the realm of politics. In Washington, D.C., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin have been working tirelessly to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, a bill that would protect the voting rights of all Americans. Yet, their efforts have been stymied by Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who seems more interested in playing a ruthless power game than in ensuring that all Americans have a say in our democracy.

""This is not about left or right, it's about right or wrong,"" Schumer said. ""We cannot allow the Republican Party to continue to disenfranchise voters and undermine our democracy.""

McConnell's actions are particularly egregious when one considers the example they set for future generations. By putting their own political power above the rights of the American people, they are teaching our children that it is acceptable to bend the rules and disregard the principles of fairness and democracy.

The hypocrisy is not limited to Washington, D.C. In Texas, the state legislature has passed a series of laws that discriminate against minorities and restrict women's rights to abortion. These laws are not only harmful to the people of Texas, but they also send a message to our children that it is acceptable to discriminate against certain groups of people.

""This is not who we are as Texans,"" said Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. ""We are better than this.""

In addition to the attacks on voting rights and women's rights, there is also a growing attack on critical race theory in education. This theory, which examines the role of race and racism in American history and society, has been falsely labeled as ""divisive"" by conservatives who want to whitewash history and prevent our children from learning the truth.

""We cannot afford to let the truth be erased,"" said Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro. ""Our children deserve to know the full history of our country, both the good and the bad.""

The hypocrisy of adults is not limited to the political arena. In North Carolina, Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson recently made derogatory remarks about the LGBTQ+ community, comparing them to ""dogs"" and ""filth."" These comments are not only offensive and harmful, but they also send a dangerous message to our children that it is acceptable to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

""This is not the North Carolina I know,"" said Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. ""We are a state that values diversity and inclusion.""

The death of Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, should have been a moment of national mourning. Instead, it has been used by some as an opportunity to push anti-vaccine narratives, despite the fact that Powell was fully vaccinated and his death was unrelated to the vaccine. This is a dangerous and irresponsible act that puts the lives of our children at risk.

""This is not about politics, it's about public health,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert. ""The vaccine is safe and effective, and it is the best way to protect ourselves and our children from COVID-19.""

Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of all of this is the impact it is having on our children. When they see the adults in their lives acting hypocritically, they learn that it is acceptable to do the same. They learn that it is okay to put their own interests above the interests of others, and that it is okay to discriminate against people who are different from them.

We need to do better. We need to set a better example for our children. We need to show them that it is possible to be both powerful and principled, and that it is important to stand up for what is right, even when it is difficult.

The future of our democracy and our society depends on it."
2121	"Facebook suspends account of Virginia state Sen. Amanda Chase

Facebook suspended the official account of a Virginia state senator and gubernatorial candidate Friday, days after the self-described ""Trump in heels"" praised rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol as ""patriots"" while also suggesting that left-wing ""antifa or BLM agents of destruction"" were really to blame. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Sen. Amanda F. Chase (R-Chesterfield), who spoke to the crowd of President Trump's supporters in Washington on Wednesday but left before they crashed through Capitol security, cannot post or comment for seven days, or post live video for 60 days on her official Senate page, according to a written notice she shared with The Washington Post. She announced Facebook's actions on her personal Facebook page, which was not affected.

""Make no mistake, the liberal left who controls social media is systematically targeting vocal supporters of President Trump in an all-out, collaborative effort to silence our voices,"" she said in an interview. ""Facebook has weaponized its community standards.""

Some Trump allies have speculated that antifa was responsible for inciting violence and storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. No evidence supports this claim. (Video: The Washington Post)

A spokesman for Facebook did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

The restrictions on Chase follow a crackdown on Trump by social media companies, who say his posts helped incite the riot. Twitter on Friday night announced it was permanently suspending Trump's account ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence,"" while Facebook announced Thursday it was banning Trump indefinitely.

Facebook has flagged several of Chase's recent posts with the tag: ""False information. Checked by independent fact-checkers."" That includes one post that claimed, ""Facial recognition firm claims Antifa infiltrated Trump Supporters.""

Twitter on Jan. 8 banned President Trump from its site, a punishment for his role in inciting violence at the U.S. Capitol. (Video: The Washington Post)

Even as Chase claimed the left was responsible for the riot, she praised the ""patriots"" who stormed the Capitol.

""These were not rioters and looters; these were Patriots who love their country and do not want to see our great republic turn into a socialist country. I was there with the people; I know. Don't believe the fake media narrative,"" Chase had written.

The state Senate's Democratic Caucus on Friday called on Chase — who last month said Trump should hang on to power by declaring martial law — to resign, accusing her of ""empowering a failed coup d'etat.""

Chase brushed off their criticism, saying Virginia Democrats had ""committed treason"" by loosening restrictions on voting last year by eliminating photo ID requirements, among other things.

The Senate Republican Caucus, which Chase quit in November 2019, declined to comment.

A suburbanite who got interested in politics as a home-schooling mom and worked for GOP establishment figure Eric Cantor before the tea party movement toppled him in 2014, Chase has been a controversial figure even within her own party. The rift became public in 2019, after she cursed out a Virginia Capitol Police officer over a parking space.

While fellow Virginia Republicans have rarely crossed Trump, Chase has gone further than most with inflammatory rhetoric. In mid-December, as her lone rival for the GOP gubernatorial nomination, Del. Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights), acknowledged President-elect Joe Biden's win in the electoral college, Chase urged Trump to declare ""martial law"" to prevent his removal from office."
17	"FDA Authorizes Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Emergency Use in Children 5 through 11 Years of Age

Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 to include children 5 through 11 years of age. The authorization was based on the FDA's thorough and transparent evaluation of the data that included input from independent advisory committee experts who overwhelmingly voted in favor of making the vaccine available to children in this age group.

Key points for parents and caregivers:

Effectiveness: Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.

Safety: The vaccine's safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11 who received the vaccine and no serious side effects have been detected in the ongoing study.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet next week to discuss further clinical recommendations.

""As a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today's authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,"" said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. ""Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine's safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.""

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms).

In the U.S., COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age make up 39% of cases in individuals younger than 18 years of age. According to the CDC, approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age resulted in hospitalization. As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.

""The FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,"" said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

The FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.

FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data

The effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.

The FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.

FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data

The available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.

Commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.

The FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA's model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.

Ongoing Safety Monitoring

Pfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.

It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA."
509	"Whistleblower says Facebook put profit before reining in hate speech

Oct 3 (Reuters) - A Facebook Inc (FB.O) whistleblower on Sunday accused the social media giant of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation, and said her lawyers have filed at least eight complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, appeared on Sunday on the CBS television program ""60 Minutes,"" revealing her identity as the whistleblower who provided the documents that underpinned a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls.

Facebook has been under fire after the Journal published a series of stories based on Facebook internal presentations and emails that showed the social media company contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm, failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy and was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls.

Haugen will testify before a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday in a hearing titled ""Protecting Kids Online,"" about the company's research into Instagram's effect on young users.

""There were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,"" she said during the interview. ""And Facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests like making more money.""

Haugen, who previously worked at Google and Pinterest, said Facebook has lied to the public about the progress it made to clamp down on hate speech and misinformation on its platform.

She added that Facebook was used to help organize the Capitol riot on January 6, after the company turned off safety systems following the U.S. presidential elections.

While she believed no one at Facebook was ""malevolent,"" she said the company had misaligned incentives.

Facebook published a statement disputing the points that Haugen made after the televised interview.

""We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content,"" said Facebook spokesperson Lena Pietsch. ""To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.""

Ahead of the 60 Minutes interview, Facebook Vice President of global affairs Nick Clegg said on CNN it was ""ludicrous"" to assert that Jan. 6 occurred because of social media.

INTERNATIONAL TALKS

On Sunday, Haugen's attorney John Tye, founder of legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid confirmed a New York Times report that some of the internal documents have been shared with attorneys general from several states including California, Vermont and Tennessee.

Tye said the complaints were filed to the SEC on the basis that as a publicly-traded company, Facebook is required to not lie to its investors, or even withhold material information.

The complaints compare Facebook's internal research with its public statements on the issues it researched, according to the 60 Minutes interview.

Tye said Haugen has also spoken with lawmakers in Europe and is scheduled to appear before the British parliament later this month, in hopes of spurring regulatory action.

He and Haugen are also interested in speaking with lawmakers from countries in Asia, since many of the issues that motivated Haugen stem from the region, including the ethnic violence in Myanmar, he added."
1583	"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Honor Martin Luther King Day with Acts of Service

British royalty Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, celebrated Martin Luther King Day by providing lunch for hardworking volunteers of The Mission Continues. The organization, dedicated to empowering veterans to serve their communities, thanked the royal couple for their support on Instagram.

Harry and Meghan expressed their gratitude and recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy in a heartfelt message, saying, ""Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his immense impact on civil rights have never been more relevant. His continued resonance is a beacon of hope amidst the turmoil we're seeing envelop the world.""

Their support for The Mission Continues reflects a larger commitment to community service, having also distributed food with the organization in November. This time, lunch for the volunteers was organized by Homegirl Catering, which is part of Homeboy Industries, an esteemed rehabilitation program for former gang members.

The couple's involvement with Homeboy Industries dates back to the COVID-19 pandemic when they lent a hand preparing meals for the #FeedHOPE program. Father Greg Boyle, founder of Homeboy Industries and a prominent Jesuit priest in Los Angeles, appreciated Harry and Meghan's efforts.

""I have seen them walk among our employees shoulder to shoulder, treating everyone with warmth and respect, offering a true kinship with the workers,"" Father Boyle shared. ""Their work ethic, and genuine connection with those they serve, is inspiring.""

Homeboy Industries offers a variety of services including mental health counseling, educational opportunities, and job training to assist at-risk individuals in making a successful transition from prison to mainstream society.

The Archewell Foundation, the Duke and Duchess' philanthropic organization, has a mission to uplift and unite communities locally, nationally, and globally. The foundation's partnership with The Mission Continues and Homeboy Industries demonstrates a shared commitment to fostering meaningful change.

In acknowledgement of their efforts, Harry and Meghan signed their message with their names, adding their titles: ""Thank you for your service. Harry, Meghan (Duke and Duchess of Sussex).""

Harry's commitment to service is well-documented, including a memorable visit to The Mission Continues' base in Compton. The couple's ongoing efforts represent their dedication to addressing issues of social justice and community well-being.

For Prince Harry, community involvement and compassionate leadership have been central themes. He has been a driving force behind numerous charitable initiatives, and his presence at The Mission Continues' Compton base reaffirmed the importance of his philanthropic endeavors.

In addition to supporting veterans and former gang members, Meghan and Harry have been actively involved in women's empowerment, mental health awareness, and environmental conservation efforts.

As they continue their humanitarian efforts, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will undoubtedly remain a beacon of hope and inspiration. Their actions on Martin Luther King Day offer a glimpse into their larger vision of creating a positive impact on communities around the world.

As we reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy, let us remember his call to service and his unwavering dedication to equality and justice for all. In their acts of kindness and service, Harry and Meghan underscore the importance of unity and empathy in the face of adversity."
1376	"Kyle Rittenhouse Acquittal: A Dangerous Precedent for Race and Gun Rights

The acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse on all counts in the shooting of three people during a Kenosha protest in 2020 is not just a legal verdict; it is a reflection of the deep-rooted issues surrounding race and gun rights in America. The 18-year-old's trial was closely watched as it unfolded in the aftermath of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man, which had sparked widespread protests.

One of the key points of contention in Rittenhouse's trial was the jury's acceptance of his emotional testimony, painting himself as a hero acting in self-defense. This acceptance raises glaring questions about the credibility of such claims in cases involving white individuals using deadly force against black victims. Rittenhouse's portrayal as a vigilante figure and a defender of property rights has garnered him support from right-wing gun rights activists, with even figures like Ted Nugent standing by his side.

The stark juxtaposition between Rittenhouse's acquittal and the guilty verdicts in the case of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man killed while jogging, highlights the disparate treatment of individuals based on their race. While Arbery's killers were rightfully held accountable for their actions, Rittenhouse's actions have been met with a disturbing level of justification and even celebration by some segments of society.

The troubling alliances that Rittenhouse has formed with controversial figures like Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump raise further alarm about his future trajectory. With his newfound notoriety and connections in right-wing circles, it is conceivable that Rittenhouse could be groomed for a future in political spheres closely associated with Trump. The potential influence that Trump might exert on Rittenhouse, particularly in terms of his behavior towards women, is a cause for genuine concern.

Rittenhouse's case serves as a stark reminder of the enduring legacy of white vigilantism and its dangerous implications for communities of color. The fact that a teenager wielding a weapon was able to walk free after taking multiple lives in a tense protest environment underscores the deeply rooted racial biases that continue to permeate the criminal justice system.

The broader implications of Rittenhouse's acquittal extend beyond the confines of this single case. It sends a chilling message to communities of color and marginalized groups that their lives hold less value in the eyes of the law when pitted against the perceived threat posed by assertive white individuals.

As we reflect on the outcome of Rittenhouse's trial, it is crucial to confront the uncomfortable truths it lays bare about race, privilege, and power dynamics in America. The narrative of a young white man being hailed as a hero for his actions in a charged racial context must be met with the greatest scrutiny and condemnation.

The normalization of Rittenhouse's actions sets a dangerous precedent for future incidents of racialized violence, emboldening individuals who seek to instigate conflict under the guise of self-defense. It is incumbent upon us as a society to denounce such behavior and strive towards a more just and equitable future for all individuals, regardless of their race or background.

In the wake of Rittenhouse's acquittal, we must remain vigilant in challenging the narratives that seek to justify violence against marginalized communities and hold those in positions of power to account for their role in perpetuating such injustices. Only through a concerted effort to dismantle systemic inequalities can we hope to create a society where true justice and equality prevail."

Patriots 10 things we learned from Episode 7 of the Tom Brady documentary, 'Man in the Arena' ""If there's one game that signifies what our team was always about, it's Super Bowl LI."" Tom Brady during Super Bowl LI. AP Photo/Darron Cummings

In the seventh episode of the Tom Brady documentary, ""Man in the Arena,"" the 44-year-old quarterback's family receives some focus while the story of the 2016 Patriots is recounted.

Interwoven with details about one of New England's most celebrated championships—culminating with the comeback from a 28-3 deficit in Super Bowl LI — Brady's three older sisters chronicle both his career and growth off the field from their unique perspective.

Maureen, Julie, and Nancy Brady joined their brother to be interviewed for the episode, discussing the team's on-field success simultaneous to the more personal story of their mother battling cancer.

Here are a few takeaways from Episode 7, titled, ""Surrender"":

The Brady family view of ""Deflategate""

After receiving coverage in the previous episode, the ""Deflategate"" controversy was once again back in the documentary as Brady's 2016 four-game suspension was discussed.

In Brady's view, the entire subplot was ""a lot about who had power and authority.""

""What it started out as vs. what it became were two totally different things,"" he explained.

Brady's siblings shared that view, noting that accusations drifted over time as the initial reports of discrepancies in the pressure of footballs were seemingly disproven by the ideal gas law.

""A lot of people were waiting for that moment to kind of dig in,"" said Nancy. ""It was vicious.""

Ultimately, Brady believed that it wasn't productive to continuously defend his actions.

""I don't need to defend myself,"" he said. ""I've defended myself for a long time. I said what I had to say multiple times, in front of a lot of different people, in court, in public. I felt I had given them what they needed to make the right decision, but I feel like they had their mind made up.""

""I realized I wasn't going to win,"" Brady said of the protracted court procedure. ""It's hard to beat 31 billionaires in court. I thought we gave it a great fight but in the end just dealing with the results of what the New York circuit judge decided. I decided to put that behind me and then move on to the next year.""

Brady's response to his mother having cancer

While the 2016 season was ultimately a happy memory for Patriots fans, it was a difficult time for the Brady family. When asked what came to mind about the year, Maureen became emotional.

""That was a hard year,"" she recalled. ""That was a really hard year. We had a lot going on with my mom and Tommy.""

Galynn Brady was diagnosed with breast cancer and myeloma in 2016. She immediately began to receive treatment, which eventually meant a difficult period of chemotherapy.

Brady offered an introspective recollection from that time.

""I tried to remain poised and say, 'Don't worry, mom, we're going to get through it,'"" said Brady. ""And then I automatically — maybe it's a little bit of a toughening up that I've had, but maybe I'm not the most empathetic or sympathetic — I'm trying to solve it.

""I'm saying, 'Mom, come on, this is what we've got to do, we've got to send you to this person, or this person,'"" Brady continued. ""We're going to fix this.""

Handling the 2016 suspension

Having to serve a four-game suspension at the outset of the 2016 season provided a stark change of pace for Brady.

""It was the first September that I'd had off since my eighth-grade year,"" Brady recalled. ""I didn't even know what a September was like without football.

Brady said that he decided to go on vacation to Costa Rica to be with his wife.

""That was really good for our relationship,"" he said of the trip with Gisele Bündchen.

""A very small gesture like that allowed me to recognize the things that I need to do in our relationship to make sure that she feels supported too,"" said Brady, ""because she'd supported me for the previous year and a half. She held me up when I was weak and angry and sad and depressed. That was a really dark time.""

But after the brutal period of ""Deflategate,"" the suspension that finally resulted from it was a positive moment.

""It actually worked out awesome for them,"" said Maureen. ""He saw our family. We haven't had a family holiday together since he was at Michigan.""

Facebook shut down a pro-Israel page that reportedly had 77 million followers, after a ""cyber terrorism"" campaign by ""radical Islamic"" groups — who coordinated to target it with hate speech, its founder said.

""Jerusalem Prayer Group"" founder Mike Evans claimed that critics bombarded the site with ""more than a million"" comments — and then said they had never posted to the site, CBN reported.

""There was an organized attempt by radical Islamic organizations to achieve this objective,"" Evans said.

""It was a very clever, deceptive plan by Islamic radicals,"" he said.

Evans — who was leading thousands in daily online prayers for Israel — claimed the flood of complaints about supposed fake posts was ""a complete scam and fraud.""

He told Arutz Sheva 7 that activists also flooded the page with vile anti-Semitic comments — include photos of and quotes by Hitler — just to be able to complain about it violating the social media giant's policies.

Evans, head of the Friends of Zion Association, told the outlet that he got the unexpected message that Facebook had removed the page when he landed in Israel ready to host a star-studded TV special.

Facebook sent him a message saying the case was ""complete"" and there was ""no further action"" to be taken. ""Please consider this decision final,"" Facebook told him, according to CBN.

He said he had not been able to speak to Facebook representatives since the page was shuttered on Friday. He also cannot post to his personal Facebook page, he said.

He has, however, been in touch with ""dozens"" of politicians, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Jared Kushner and his ""dear friend"" former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to help him ""with this fraudulent scheme to damage our good work,"" he told CBN.

""Facebook got caught with its pants down,"" he insisted.

""This is a prime example of bias on steroids. It's, in my opinion, cyber terrorism based upon racism.""

A Facebook company spokesperson said: ""We removed Jerusalem Prayer Team's Facebook Page for violating our rules against spam and inauthentic behavior.""

1237	"Texas may be in danger of another major energy crisis and widespread power outages this winter, new report warns

A new report found that Texas could be in danger of widespread power outages again in the case of extreme winter weather.

The state is still grappling with the fallout of deadly February storms that left millions without electricity and water.

If a storm hits, the Texas power grid is projected to be 37% short of providing the total energy needed for the state.

Residents of the Lone Star State may have another long, difficult winter ahead.

Texas is once again in danger of widespread power outages if extreme weather strikes this season, according to a new report from the non-profit North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a harrowing warning after the state was devastated by severe storms earlier this year.

While NERC also indicated risk for additional regions in the South and the Midwest, the greatest risk remains with Texas, which is projected to fall 37% short of providing the total energy needed in the case of a storm.

The evaluation comes as the state continues to grapple with the fallout of historic February storms that brought freezing temperatures, snow, and ice and left millions of Texans without electricity and clean water for days on end. The unprecedented weather left 210 people dead and led to more than $50 billion in damages, prompting the Biden Administration to declare a national disaster in the state.

In the aftermath, many residents also faced a slew of billing and insurance issues, causing some to be saddled with astronomical electric bills of upwards of $1,000 a day because their plans were tied to wholesale rates.

""Winter Storm Uri highlighted the vulnerabilities of our electricity and natural gas systems during long duration, widespread cold-weather conditions,"" Mark Olson, NERC's manager of reliability assessments, said in a press statement. ""The industry has taken major steps to prepare for extreme weather conditions this winter, but our existing generation fleet and fuel infrastructure remain exposed in many areas.""

To further mitigate outages, NERC said power companies should take proactive measures to prepare for extreme winter weather, including implementing emergency operating plans, conducting drills, and polling generators for fuel and availability status.

""To be resilient in extreme weather, we are counting on our grid operators to proactively monitor the generation fleet, adjust operating plans and keep the lines of communication open,"" Olson said in the press statement.

According to News 4 San Antonio, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas — the company that operates the Texas power grid — plans to inspect 300 power plants during the course of 21 days in December in an effort to prevent power outages.

""To see what could happen under extreme cases in ERCOT, I think is very disappointing and something that we need to see how we can rectify,"" John Moura, NERC's director of reliability assessment, told News 4."

Trump's suspension would end in time for the 2024 election cycle.

Trump condemned the decision, adding 'no more dinners' with the Zuckerbergs if he is re-elected.

The Biden White House said it's 'pretty unlikely that the zebra is going to change his stripes.'

Facebook suspended former President Donald Trump for two years but ending just in time for him to possibly regain his powerful social media megaphone in the 2024 election cycle.

After that period, Facebook said it would consult experts to determine whether ""the risk to public safety has receded,"" and make a call on Trump's return.

But Facebook warned that Trump's Facebook and Instagram, if reinstated, would face a ""strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions"" if he violates the company's rules again after being reinstated on Jan. 7, 2023.

Trump's accounts on Facebook and Instagram were frozen the day after the attack on the U.S. Capitol for his praise of supporters who stormed it, Facebook said.

""When the suspension is eventually lifted, there will be a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions that will be triggered if Mr. Trump commits further violations in future, up to and including permanent removal of his pages and accounts,"" Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications Nick Clegg said Friday.

Facebook after Trump suspension: Political speech of world leaders will get less preferential treatment

As part of Friday's announcement, Facebook said it would no longer grant politicians and other public figures special exemptions from its content policies after the social media giant faced a firestorm of criticism for being unclear on how and why it treats the speech of world leaders differently from any other user.

Public figures who foment violence during periods of civil unrest could face penalties ranging from one-month to two-year suspensions, the company said.

""Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr. Trump's suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols,"" Clegg said.

2165	"Facebook and Twitch Incidents Highlight the Significance of Cloud Misconfigurations for Businesses, Warns Fugue CEO

FREDERICK, Md. – In the wake of high-profile incidents affecting Facebook and Twitch, the CEO of cloud security company Fugue is urging business and security leaders to take a closer look at their cloud environments and the risks posed by misconfigurations.

Josh Stella, CEO and co-founder of Fugue, commented, ""The recent incidents at Facebook and Twitch serve as a stark reminder that misconfigurations in the cloud can lead to significant vulnerabilities and operational disruptions. In both cases, the root cause was a misconfiguration, resulting in substantial losses for these companies.""

According to a recent report, 36% of companies experienced a serious cloud security leak or breach due to misconfiguration in the past year. Stella emphasized, ""Configuration, rather than the network, is now the main attack surface for cloud environments. Hackers are increasingly utilizing automation to find and exploit cloud misconfigurations for unauthorized access and data breaches.""

Cloud environments are constantly evolving, with new services, applications, and infrastructure being added regularly. Stella explained, ""The constant change introduces risk with every modification. It's essential for businesses to know the current state of their cloud environments and vulnerabilities to mitigate these risks.""

Preventive measures, such as Policy as Code, can help mitigate misconfiguration risks. Stella stated, ""Policy as Code is an essential practice for cloud security. It automates the enforcement of security policies across infrastructure and applications, reducing the risk of human error and misconfiguration.""

However, Stella emphasized that cultural and operational shifts toward security-focused practices in cloud management are also essential for mitigating risks. ""Security must be a priority from the outset, not an afterthought. This includes training and empowering teams to make secure decisions, implementing DevSecOps practices, and continuously monitoring and securing cloud environments.""

Stella concluded, ""The incidents at Facebook and Twitch are a wake-up call for businesses. Misconfigurations in the cloud can have serious consequences, from operational disruptions to financial losses and reputational damage. It's crucial for business and security leaders to take a proactive approach to cloud security and prioritize the prevention of misconfigurations."""

(Edward Osborne Wilson, a groundbreaking biologist known for his work on ants and sociobiology, faced controversy and opposition throughout his career, but his passion for nature and exploration led to major scientific discoveries and efforts to preserve biodiversity. Born with a love for the natural world, Wilson described hundreds of new species and studied social insect behavior, changing our understanding of communication and behavior. However, his pioneering work in sociobiology, which linked behavior to evolutionary and genetic factors, sparked widespread debate and controversy. Wilson experienced physical attacks and fierce opposition from figures like Richard Lewontin and Steve Gould, but he sought to address the controversy with his Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""On Human Nature."" Despite a difficult childhood and loss of vision in one eye, Wilson's passion for exploring nature persisted, leading him to major scientific discoveries. He distanced himself from fundamentalist Protestantism after discovering evolutionary theory, and while not an atheist, he expressed skepticism about organized religion.

1161	"Debunking the Myth: No SEAL Rescue of Children from Ever Given Ship

A story has been circulating online, claiming that U.S. Navy SEALs rescued over a thousand trafficked children from the cargo ship Ever Given, which became notoriously stuck in the Suez Canal in March 2021. This narrative has spread across social media and various websites, weaving elaborate details, including the recovery of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) and implicating high-profile entities such as Walmart and the Clinton Foundation in an international child trafficking ring. Our investigation reveals that these claims are unequivocally false, rooted in conspiracy theories with no basis in reality.

The origin of this baseless story can be traced back to Before It's News, a website notorious for its publication of misleading and outright false content. Despite the sensational nature of the claims made in the article, no credible news publisher or official government entity has confirmed any such rescue operation by Navy SEALs or the discovery of WMDs aboard the Ever Given.

The Ever Given, a massive cargo ship, did indeed run aground in the Suez Canal in March 2021, causing a significant disruption in maritime traffic. This much is true. However, the narrative that unfolded thereafter, claiming a dramatic rescue of trafficked children and the recovery of dangerous weapons, is entirely fabricated.

The false story further alleges that the Ever Given was co-owned by Walmart and the Clinton Foundation, using this fictional ownership stake to involve them in a non-existent child trafficking conspiracy. This element of the tale is also without merit. Neither Walmart nor the Clinton Foundation have any ownership of the Ever Given or any involvement in the events purportedly unfolding on the ship.

Compounding these fabrications, the narrative contends that trafficked children were being ordered through catalogs, similar to items on Wayfair, by pedophiles around the globe. This bizarre claim echoes similar baseless allegations made about the Wayfair online shopping website in July 2020, which were also thoroughly debunked.

Supporting this concocted story, mentions of a non-existent 'telegram' were cited, claiming the U.S. Navy SEALs found both live and dead children in cargo containers on the ship. This detail, like the others before it, is completely unsubstantiated and appears to be a tactic used to lend the narrative an air of credibility where none exists.

It's important to note that similarly unfounded trafficking claims were levied against Wayfair in July 2020, alleging that the company was selling extraordinarily expensive furniture as a front for human trafficking. These allegations were widely debunked after gaining brief traction on social media, yet they seem to have inspired the current false narrative surrounding the Ever Given.

Our investigation into these claims reveals a total lack of credible reporting or evidence to support the dramatic rescue operation, the discovery of WMDs, or any involvement by named corporations or foundations in child trafficking. These stories serve as a stark reminder of the ease with which unfounded rumors can spread in the digital age, often gaining a life of their own despite having no basis in fact.

The implications of such false narratives are not merely confined to the realm of internet gossip. They can have real-world consequences, including diverting attention from legitimate cases of trafficking, wasting law enforcement resources, and unjustly tarnishing the reputations of individuals and organizations implicated in these fabrications.

In conclusion, the claims of U.S. Navy SEALs conducting a dramatic rescue of trafficked children from the Ever Given ship are entirely false. No evidence supports the recovery of WMDs, the involvement of Walmart or the Clinton Foundation in child trafficking, or the existence of a child ordering catalog akin to Wayfair. These allegations are without merit, rooted in conspiracy theories rather than facts. It's crucial to approach such sensational stories with skepticism and to rely on credible sources for information, particularly in an era where misinformation can spread rapidly and unchecked."

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are honoring Martin Luther King Day with a special gesture.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex provided some lunchtime fuel for the Los Angeles nonprofit The Mission Continues over the holiday weekend — and referenced the civil rights pioneer as a source of inspiration.

""In honor of this day of service, and in recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and all that he stood for, we want to send our thanks and gratitude to the team at The Mission Continues,"" Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, said in a message to the organization's volunteers.

987	"World's largest container ship 'EVER ACE' successfully transits Suez Canal

Built by the Samsung Heavy Industries for Evergreen Marine Corporation, the world's largest container ship 'EVER ACE' successfully crossed Suez Canal on its maiden voyage en route to the port of Rotterdam of the Netherlands.

On August 28, the container ship made waves and turned heads with its unusual appearance. The EVER ACE is the first of a series of 12 container ships ordered by Evergreen in China and South Korea shipyard and was officially delivered by the builder on July 29.

This monstrous floating box has a carrying capacity of 23,992 TEU, making it the largest such vessel in the world. It takes the title from the HMM Algeciras of 23,964 TEU, which visited Rotterdam on its maiden voyage just last June. The container ship measures 400 meters long, 61.53 meters wide, and weighs approximately 235,000 tons.

Because of the ship's larger size, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) followed its protocols and offered navigation support during the transit, ensuring a safe passage of the ship. The Suez Canal Authority said the EVER ACE's smooth passage through the canal reflects the route's ability to accommodate current and future giant container ships.

In early August, the EVER ACE container ship set sail from the Port of Taipei in Taiwan, beginning its maiden voyage. The Panama-flagged EVER ACE ship is en route from China to the port of Rotterdam of the Netherlands, where it is expected to reach on September 4.

Evergreen Marine Corporation also owns the Ever Given ship, which made the headlines in March for blocking the Suez Canal and causing a major disruption in global trade. The ship was refloated after a major six-day salvage operation and was escorted through the 193km (120-mile) canal by two tugboats."
1944	"Colin Powell, former general and secretary of state, dead at 84

Colin Powell, a retired four-star general and White House national security adviser who served as the nation's first black secretary of state, died Monday as a result of complications from COVID-19, his family said.

The 84-year-old was fully vaccinated against the virus but had been treated over the past few years for multiple myeloma — a type of blood cancer that can limit the body's ability to fight infection, according to his longtime aide.

In his four decades of public life, Powell was the first black man to serve as national security adviser near the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993. In the latter role, he oversaw the US invasion of Panama and later the US invasion of Kuwait to oust the Iraqi army in 1991.

""General Colin L. Powell, former U.S. Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, passed away this morning due to complications from Covid 19. He was fully vaccinated,"" his family said in a statement on Facebook.

""We want to thank the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment. We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American.""

Powell's family did not address whether he had any underlying illnesses, but his aide Peggy Cifrino confirmed he had been battling multiple myeloma.

It wasn't immediately clear what complications he suffered or how long Powell had been in the hospital prior to his death.

He is survived by his wife of nearly 60 years, Alma Powell, and their three children.

Powell was also the first black secretary of state during President George W. Bush's first term from 2001 to 2005.

His reputation suffered a painful setback in 2003 when he delivered a speech to the United Nations Security Council to make the case that the US should go to war against Iraq.

He later admitted his speech was rife with inaccuracies and false intelligence that claimed there was evidence Iraq and Saddam Hussein were hiding weapons of mass destruction.

Powell resigned in 2005 and later referred to his UN speech as a ""blot"" that would forever tarnish his record.

In his 2012 memoir ""It Worked for Me,"" Powell wrote: ""I am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me.

""It was by no means my first, but it was one of my most momentous failures, the one with the widest-ranging impact.""

He added: ""The event will earn a prominent paragraph in my obituary.""

Bush was among those to lead the tributes for Powell, saying he was ""highly respected at home and abroad.""

""He was a great public servant starting with his time as a soldier during Vietnam. Many presidents relied on General Powell's counsel and experience. He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom — twice,"" Bush said in a statement.

""He was highly respected at home and abroad. And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend. Laura and I sent Alma and their children our sincere condolences as they remember the life of a great man.""

President Joe Biden hailed Powell as a patriot who broke down racial barriers and ""embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat.""

""Having fought in wars, he understood better than anyone that military might alone was not enough to maintain our peace and prosperity. From his front-seat view of history, advising presidents and shaping our nation's policies, Colin led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong. Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else — in uniform and out — and it earned him the universal respect of the American people,"" Biden said in a statement.

""Above all, Colin was my friend. Easy to share a laugh with. A trusted confidant in good and hard times. He could drive his Corvette Stingray like nobody's business."
1094	"WHO lists additional COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use and issues interim policy recommendations

WHO today listed the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving the green light for this vaccine to be rolled out globally. The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG).

""The addition of this vaccine has the potential to rapidly accelerate COVID-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk,"" said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products. ""We urge the manufacturer to participate in the COVAX Facility and contribute to the goal of more equitable vaccine distribution.""

WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.

The EUL assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements. The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions.

In the case of the Sinopharm vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.

The Sinopharm product is an inactivated vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell). Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings. It is the also first vaccine that will carry a vaccine vial monitor, a small sticker on the vaccine vials that change color as the vaccine is exposed to heat, letting health workers know whether the vaccine can be safely used."
